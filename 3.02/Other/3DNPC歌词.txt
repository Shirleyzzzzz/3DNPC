1 Song
【Tale of the Tongues】

Alduin's wings they did darken the sky; His roar fury's fire and his scales sharpened scythes;
Men ran and they cowered and they fought and they died; They burned and they bled as they issued their cries;
We need saviors to free us from Alduin's rage; Heroes on the field of this new war to wage;
And if Alduin wins, men is gone from this world; Lost in the shadows of the black wings unfurled;
But then came the Tongues on that terrible day; Steadfast as winter they entered the fray;
And all heard the music of Alduin's doom; The sweet song of Skyrim, sky-shattering Thu'um;
And so the Tongues freed us from Alduin's rage; Gave the gift of the Voice, ushered in a new age;
If Alduin's eternal then eternity's done; For his story is over and the dragons are gone.

【Tears of the Hist】

Clouds sweep over the sky; Floods the swamps of my eyes; 
Rain falls on Black Marsh, year after year, but the Hist sheds not a tear.
Forests of green slowly fade; Mists like ghosts of the day; 
（也有几首的词唱成了这样：Forests of green slowly fade; As mists like ghosts of the day;）
Storms rage through Black Marsh, year after year, but the Hist sheds not a tear;
Death comes for all we hold dear, but for the Hist shed not a tear.
====================
3 Song
【Age of Aggression】

We drink to our youth, and to days come and gone. For the Age of Aggression is now nearly done.
We'll drive out the Stormcloaks and restore what we own. With our blood and our steel we will take back our home.
Down with Ulfric!  The killer of kings!  On the day of your death, we'll drink and we'll sing!
We're the children of Skyrim, and we fight all our lives. And when Sovngarde beckons, every one of us dies!
But this land is ours and we'll see it wiped clean. Of the scourge that has sullied our hopes and our dreams.
====================
4 Song
【The Wolves of Jorrvaskr】

The Wolf strode upon great Jorrvaskr, to meet the sons of Ysgramor;
They said what are you but a harbinger, to leave us hopeless and forlorn;
The Wolf bore its fangs and spread its claws, and tore at its own hide;
Drink the blood, and become my sons, or by dawn you'll not survive;
And so the pack was born again as the Wolves of Jorrvaskr;
To rule in life and serve in death, as the moonlight bound hunter.

====================
5 Song
【Age of Oppression】
We drink to our youth, and to days come and gone; For the age of oppression is now nearly done.
We'll drive out the Empire from this land that we own; With our blood and our steel we will take back our home.
All hail to Ulfric! You are the High King!  In your great honor we drink and we sing.
We're the children of Skyrim, and we fight all our lives. And when Sovngarde beckons, every one of us dies!
But this land is ours and we'll see it wiped clean. Of the scourge that has sullied our hopes and our dreams.
====================
6 Song
【Mogo's Mead】
I knew meself a maiden fair,
With em'rald eyes and fire-red hair!
She owned a tavern by the sea,
And served warm drinks of mellow honey!

Drink ye merry, drink ye thirsty,
Bring thy crew n'revel freely!
For on one thing we're all agreed,
That Mogo made the finest mead!

Mogo's mead, Mogo's mead,
The only drink we'd e'er need!
Take a flask and take a seat,
And drink thyself a sweety-treat!
=====================
7 Song
【Dragornborn Comes】
Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart!  
I tell you, I tell you, the Dragonborn comes;
Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart!  
I tell you, I tell you, the Dragonborn comes;
It's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes; Beware, beware the Dragonborn comes;
For the darkness has passed and the legend yet grows; 
You'll know, you'll know the Dragonborn comes.
=====================
8 Song
【Ragnar the Red】
Oh, there once was a hero named Ragnar the Red, who came riding to Whiterun from ole Rorikstead!
And the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade, as he told of bold battles and gold he had made!
But then he went quiet, did Ragnar the Red, when he met the shield-maiden Matilda who said;
Oh, you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead! Now I think it's high time that you lie down and bleed!
And so then came the clashing and slashing of steel, as the brave lass Matilda charged in full of zeal!
And the braggart named Ragnar was boastful no more!  When his ugly red head rolled around on the floor!
======================
9 Song
【A Warrior's Life】
All across this great white land, we fight to die with sword in hand;
Bandit, pirate, soldier, or king, for a warrior's life we shout and we sing!
{Drum}
A warrior's life, through and through, fighting wars old and new; 
and when it's done, take me home, across the bridge of old whale bone!
Give me an ale and give me a beer!
{Drum}
A salty wench and plenty of cheer! 
Give me a brawl or two or three, and bards to sing of you and me!
A warrior's life, through and through, fighting wars old and new;
and when it's done, take me home, to the great mead hall of ancient stone!
=====================
10 Song
【Alassea's song】
Through the snows I have followed you, watched you fight for what's right and true;
Through chilling nights we have watched the stars, huddled close by the fire, mending scars;
When darkness came you wiped my tears, I remember your hand on mine;
Now all I wish when I close my eyes, is that you'll still be there when I wake.
=====================
11 Song
【Dusk on Anvil Harbor】
Waves touch the coast, harbored in twilight's blue; From dawn came the sunlight, and with dusk it fades from our view;
Calm embraces the sky, while storms rage in our hearts; 
For honor, glory, and love, from Anvil we do depart;
The fire lights the path, and the salt, it sprays in our eyes;  But warriors born of stone, they are never afraid to die;
{Ah~}
Bells on the docks, they cry out for the mortal day; And winds sing the dirge, for words we never could say;
And sails fly at half mast, in the color of evening's hue; 
And tears break the silence, for the children we almost knew;
{Ah~}
When dawn kissed the ocean, from the golden light came our birth; 
And when dusk falls on the harbor, to the golden shores we will return.
=====================
12 Song
【Elydi the Bear】
Bards often share, tales of heroes with flair; like Ysmir and Olaf One-Eye;
But none can compare to Eyldi the Bear; who moved heaven and earth with her cry!
It began with an oath, to drive out the foes, the dark whose faces were white;
It began with an oath, to drive out the foes, the dark whose faces were white;
But the weather was fair as a maid's golden hair; Like Springtime in old Stros M'Kai!
That's when Eyldi the Bear spun wind from the air; And wrestled a storm from the sky!
The wind in their sails, "For glory" they hailed , through ghosts to the Rim of the Sky;
But none would be there, if not for Eyldi the Bear, whose voice was the echo of Kyne!

【Gone with the Snow】
I no longer see you, gone with the snow...
And if I look hard enough, then maybe you'll be safe in my arms soon...
Where are you? Where are you?
I know longer you see you, gone with the snow...
Though I never stopped looking, 
you're never be safe in my arms...again.

【With Bells On】
Orthor the Breton was very poor and worked his days at the General Store, but every night he'd creep out back, and put on his floppy jester hat!
Bells on, with bells on! He jigged and juggled with bells on, he forgot his troubles and forgot his woes, so long as his shoes had curly toes!
Bells on, with bells on! He jigged and juggled with bells on, a floppy hat brings a world of treasure, when one man's junk is another's treasure!
