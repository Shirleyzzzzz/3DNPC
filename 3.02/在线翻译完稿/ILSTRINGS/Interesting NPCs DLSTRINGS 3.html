/>To All True Sons of Skyrim,<br
/><br
/>The guards don't listen to me. I've told them one of those gray-skins is up to something. Always heading out to the docks at night. Sending signals to her friends in Morrowind no doubt. Damn darkies are going to overrun the city if we don't stop them.<br

/><br
/>致所有真正的天际子民,<br
/><br
/>卫兵不肯听我的话，我已经告诉过他们那些灰皮佬里的某个在生事了。她总是在深夜里去码头，无疑是在给她晨风省的同伙发信号。 如果我们不阻止她们的话，该死的黑暗精灵就要淹没这个城市了。<br

/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Source&gt;Zora has expressed some concern over her sister's whereabouts.&nbsp; In Riverwood, Orgnar heard news of witches being sought by the Jarls of Whiterun and Falkreath.&nbsp; There we met a prisoner named Lyrik who was the last to see her sister, and another mysterious stranger.&lt;/Source&gt;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Dest&gt;佐拉关心起她姐妹的去向了。在Riverwood, Orgnar打听到一些关于 Whiterun 和 Falkreath的领主在找的女巫的消息。在那里我们遇到一个叫Lyrik的囚犯，他最近看到了佐拉的姐妹，一起的还有另一个神秘陌生人。&lt;/Dest&gt;<br

/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Source&gt;I have received a letter from a mysterious stranger who claims to be an old friend of Anum-La's.&nbsp; It turned out to be one of her old company members, Bodan.&nbsp; His arrival came with grave news, however, as someone has been killing their old companions. Bodan asked we vet a lead for him regarding a noble they previously thwarted.&nbsp; We learned that the lord is not responsible for the deaths, but has sent sellswords after us to stop our meddling.&nbsp; We should return to Bodan.&lt;/Source&gt;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Dest&gt;我收到一封信，一个自称是 Anum-La 的老朋友的神秘陌生人带来的，据信是她的一个旧伙伴Bodan.&nbsp; 他带着噩耗而来：有人正在谋杀旧伙伴们。. Bodan要求我们先调查一个和他们有过节的贵族。我们调查过后意识到那个贵族和旧伙伴之死无关但已派出佣兵要阻止我们继续插手。 我们应该回报Bodan.&lt;/Dest&gt;<br

/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Dest&gt;踏遍天际的寻师之旅后，貌似Rumarin凭着天赋学的最好。用无伤害的连续射击强迫他引导了一个超弱的防护结界法术，只有大概一个金币那么大。 过段时间,，Rumarin 可能可以把这个天赋发展成一个次级防护结界。&lt;/Dest&gt;<br

/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Dest&gt; 在 Bee and Barb 的 Keerava 收到一封信提及一个和土匪群里的高超射手。这个描述和 Brakh's quarry, Lagdu 相符。我该把这信给领主看看。&lt;/Dest&gt;<br

/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Dest&gt;我们宰了那只传说中的三牙海象，拔牙割肉，不过还要烹饪一下。&nbsp; Callen 认识一个 Markarth 的厨师有够疯狂会接受我们的请求的。&lt;/Dest&gt;<br

/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Dest&gt;Dalum-Ei 的暗杀者身份被揭发出来了。 他认为荣誉高于忠诚，在军队服役时犯了错，并且认为荣光八人众有杀人罪。&nbsp; Anum-La, 一边感伤于失去一位朋友，一边不得不处理掉另一位。她透露了为什么那么喜欢那棵树，因为那树让她回忆起她加入荣光八人众的时光。&lt;/Dest&gt;<br

/><br
/>Those were the words Gromash the Stone Hand vowed when I questioned his commitment. The last two men I hired didn't last the day.&nbsp; Casimir the Brave died defending me from a Forsworn ambush. His replacement, Sorek the Sellsword, fought valiantly against a Draugr lord, only to be felled by a wolf the morning after.&nbsp; Gromash was strong, peerless, but I wanted him to know that I fought from a distance.&nbsp; It would be up to him, and him alone, to hold the line.<br
/><br
/>Gromash relished the opportunity. His enduring hand was surpassed only by his tireless mouth.&nbsp; An Orc follows to the death, he reminded me, something a human would never understand.&nbsp; According to him, it wasn't the cords of muscle or the sharpness of his axe. It was his determination.&nbsp; That's what gave him strength.<br
/><br
/>Halfway through our journey we came across Gloomreach Cave, tucked against the rock near a grove of withered trees. The cave had been marked by Falmer. Nasty creatures with a taste for blood and a nose for treasure.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was wary of going inside, but Gromash merely laughed at my cowardice.<br
/><br
/>True to his word, I had nothing to fear standing behind this mighty Orc.&nbsp; Body after body fell to the ground with a mighty crash, his stone hand speaking as loudly as his mouth.&nbsp; Everywhere we went, the same sound kept ringing consistently in my ear.&nbsp; The sound of a skull cracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Two dozen cracks later and we reached the center of the hive.&nbsp; It was there that my eyes were drawn to the beautiful tassels of blue that lined the ceiling.&nbsp; I was mesmerized, so much so that I didn't notice the chasm that lay ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gromash's eyes were drawn as well, but to the Falmer who crept along the edge of the ravine.<br
/><br
/>Gromash did what he always did.&nbsp; He charged.<br
/><br
/>I nocked an arrow, hastily trying to shoot my companion in the leg and save him from his own aggression. Only my clumsy hands betrayed me.&nbsp; The Orc continued his stampede.&nbsp; I fumbled my bow.<br
/><br
/>Then a heard a sound.&nbsp; Only it wasn't the familiar crack of a skull.&nbsp; It was a sound I hadn't heard once in my time with Gromash.&nbsp; It was the sound of a blade, caroming off a shield.&nbsp; It was a block!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Never had I heard such sweet music.&nbsp; It was the force of the block, after all, that pushed my companion back to safety.&nbsp; Had Gromash's blow struck, the momentum would have surely drove him off the ledge, and I would have been forced to mourn three followers in as many days.<br
/><br
/>I lit a torch and rushed to his side, nearly stumbling over a tiny ditch in my haste.&nbsp; I fully expected him to mock my late arrival, or weave this into another tale of Orc bravery. Yet the mighty Orc never turned to me. Gone were all the taunts and swagger. Gromash never moved.&nbsp; He simply kept his eyes fixated on the drop below.<br
/><br
/>He remained silent as we made our way back out of the cave. We found a passageway that brought us back to the entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp; All that was left was a single, ten foot drop.&nbsp; I threw down our spoils and leapt down after it.&nbsp; Dawn was on the horizon, and a shaft of light hit a small garden that managed to grow amidst the dim surroundings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The scene was breathtaking enough that even an Orc might appreciate its ordinary beauty, yet when I turned to Gromash I found him frozen on the ledge. He wasn't looking at the scenery.&nbsp; He was looking straight down. It was then that I noticed his hands. The Stone Hands were trembling.<br
/><br
/>I tried coaxing.&nbsp; Pleading.&nbsp; I climbed back up the ledge and tried pushing him, striking him, and when my arms grew weary I tried bruising his fragile ego. He never budged. An Orc follows to the death, he boasted, but the only thing dead was his nerves.<br
/><br
/>From time to time I would return to the cave to check in on my old companion. My old friend. I considered telling his brethren at Dushnikh Yal he died in battle, but I still hold out hope he will conquer his fear and spin it into another harrowing tale. Yet my fear is that many years and many followers later, Gromash the Fearful will still be waiting near the entrance of Gloomreach Cavern, unable to jump down from the ledge, a monument to everything an Orc should not be.&nbsp;<br

/>Dear Finn,&nbsp;<br
/>It is a hard truth to wake up in a strange bed in a strange land, and not know your mode of travel.&nbsp; And yet the more frightening prospect is that this truth - that my mind is in slow decline - is one I have learned a thousand times over, and will forget the moment I turn this page.<br
/><br
/>Was it your idea to come to Skyrim?&nbsp; Was it mine?&nbsp; I suppose the answer is irrelevant.&nbsp; You will be happy to know that I am not a Draugr yet, for my mind is still sharp enough.&nbsp; For one, I can deduce that given my health, I would not have ventured this far from my homeland without reason, and I pray to the Divines that this reason is a cure.<br
/><br
/>Second, there are still fragments of memory that persist in my head, tiny wicks of flame lighting this unknowable path.&nbsp; When I awoke in Riverwood, two things came to mind.&nbsp; A place, and a name.&nbsp; The place was Greywater Grotto, in Falkreath to the south.&nbsp; The name was Anise.&nbsp; An errand boy named Hjoromir said he knew of just such a woman, living in a cabin north of the White River.<br
/><br
/>So, following his directions, I aim to go north.&nbsp; Forward.&nbsp; Away from home, and all that I love.&nbsp; Even now, there's a part of me yearning for the warm forests of Falkreath, to be but a league and a fortnight away from Spring in Cyrodiil.&nbsp; Such are the whims of fate, to tempt the traveler even as he brings her aid.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus I must weather each trial, do all that I can to endure.&nbsp; I can only hope that the boy's directions are sound.<br
/><br

/>亲爱的法恩：<br
/><br
/>这真是个残酷的事实，一觉醒来发现自己睡在一张陌生的床上，周围是一片陌生的土地，而且还不知道自己的旅行方式。而更加残酷的事实是：我的思维正在快速的减缓，那些我已经记了上千遍的事情也在打开这一页的时候烟消云散了。<br

/>来天际省的书一是你出的吗？还是我出的？我想答案已经无关紧要了。你应该会为我还没有变成尸鬼而高兴，因为我的头脑现在还是足够犀利的。其一，我的推测给了我生命，我才不会毫无原因的在这么远离家乡的地方冒险。我向圣灵祈祷希望这个原因是一种治愈之道。<br
/>其二，仍然有许多记忆的碎片在我头脑中回荡着，纤细的灯芯放出微弱火光照耀这条未知的道路。在河木镇醒来时，我想起了两件事。一个地点，一个名字。那个地点是位于弗克瑞斯的灰水岩洞。而那个名字是八角。一个叫肖罗密尔的伙计说他正好知道这样的一个妇人，他住在白水河以北的一间小木屋里。<br
/><br
/>所以，在他的指引下，我决定北行。前行。远离家和所有我之所爱。即使是现在，我的内心的一部分还是向往弗克瑞斯那温暖的森林，to be but a league and a fortnight away from Spring in Cyrodiil. 就像命运一时心血来潮去试探旅人，甚至给予其帮助。所以我必须忍受住每次测验，用尽全力去忍受。我只能寄希望于那个男孩的指引是正确的。<br

/><br
/>Those were the words Ghorbash the Stone Hand vowed when I questioned his commitment. The last two men I hired didn't last the day.&nbsp; Casimir the Brave died defending me from a Forsworn ambush. His replacement, Sorek the Sellsword, fought valiantly against a Draugr lord, only to be felled by a wolf the morning after.&nbsp; Ghorbash was strong, peerless, but I wanted him to know that I fought from a distance.&nbsp; It would be up to him, and him alone, to hold the line.<br
/><br
/>Ghorbash relished the opportunity. His enduring hand was surpassed only by his tireless mouth.&nbsp; An Orc follows to the death, he reminded me, something a human would never understand.&nbsp; According to him, it wasn't the cords of muscle or the sharpness of his axe. It was his determination.&nbsp; That's what gave him strength.<br
/><br
/>Halfway through our journey we came across Gloomreach Cave, tucked against the rock near a grove of withered trees. The cave had been marked by Falmer. Nasty creatures with a taste for blood and a nose for treasure.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was wary of going inside, but Ghorbash merely laughed at my cowardice.<br
/><br
/>True to his word, I had nothing to fear standing behind this mighty Orc.&nbsp; Body after body fell to the ground with a mighty crash, his stone hand speaking as loudly as his mouth.&nbsp; Everywhere we went, the same sound kept ringing consistently in my ear.&nbsp; The sound of a skull cracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Two dozen cracks later and we reached the center of the hive.&nbsp; It was there that my eyes were drawn to the beautiful tassels of blue that lined the ceiling.&nbsp; I was mesmerized, so much so that I didn't notice the chasm that lay ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ghorbash's eyes were drawn as well, but to the Falmer who crept along the edge of the ravine.<br
/><br
/>Ghorbash did what he always did.&nbsp; He charged.<br
/><br
/>I nocked an arrow, hastily trying to shoot my companion in the leg and save him from his own aggression. Only my clumsy hands betrayed me.&nbsp; The Orc continued his stampede.&nbsp; I fumbled my bow.<br
/><br
/>Then a heard a sound.&nbsp; Only it wasn't the familiar crack of a skull.&nbsp; It was a sound I hadn't heard once in my time with Ghorbash.&nbsp; It was the sound of a blade, caroming off a shield.&nbsp; It was a block!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Never had I heard such sweet music.&nbsp; It was the force of the block, after all, that pushed my companion back to safety.&nbsp; Had Ghorbash's blow struck, the momentum would have surely drove him off the ledge, and I would have been forced to mourn three followers in as many days.<br
/><br
/>I lit a torch and rushed to his side, nearly stumbling over a tiny ditch in my haste.&nbsp; I fully expected him to mock my late arrival, or weave this into another tale of Orc bravery. Yet the mighty Orc never turned to me. Gone were all the taunts and swagger. Ghorbash never moved.&nbsp; He simply kept his eyes fixated on the drop below.<br
/><br
/>He remained silent as we made our way back out of the cave. We found a passageway that brought us back to the entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp; All that was left was a single, ten foot drop.&nbsp; I threw down our spoils and leapt down after it.&nbsp; Dawn was on the horizon, and a shaft of light hit a small garden that managed to grow amidst the dim surroundings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The scene was breathtaking enough that even an Orc might appreciate its ordinary beauty, yet when I turned to Ghorbash I found him frozen on the ledge. He wasn't looking at the scenery.&nbsp; He was looking straight down. It was then that I noticed his hands. The Stone Hands were trembling.<br
/><br
/>I tried coaxing.&nbsp; Pleading.&nbsp; I climbed back up the ledge and tried pushing him, striking him, and when my arms grew weary I tried bruising his fragile ego. He never budged. An Orc follows to the death, he boasted, but the only thing dead was his nerves.<br
/><br
/>From time to time I would return to the cave to check in on my old companion. My old friend. I considered telling his brethren at Dushnikh Yal he died in battle, but I still hold out hope he will conquer his fear and spin it into another harrowing tale. Yet my fear is that many years and many followers later, Ghorbash the Fearful will still be waiting near the entrance of Gloomreach Cavern, unable to jump down from the ledge, a monument to everything an Orc should not be.&nbsp;<br

/><br

/><br
/>As the Hollow-Faced Men had warned me, undead flesh tends to be unpredictable.&nbsp; Mummified corpses often flake into ash, but vampire flesh is at times brittle, and at times too stubborn to mold.&nbsp; This I do not divulge to the Breton.&nbsp; No need to cause alarm in the pretty little thing.<br

/><br

/><br
/><br

/>&lt;p align="left"&gt;<br
/>&lt;img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'&gt;here is little doubt that Ysgramor's progeny exist throughout Skyrim. Most of these ill-conceived sons and daughters of the Nord king likely have no idea nobility courses through their blood. Unfortunately, there is no way to prove this lineage, as the ancient Nords were terrible record keepers, choosing poem and song over the more didactic practices.<br
/><br
/>This isn't to say the Nords didn't keep written records of their family history. There is evidence that an encrypted scroll exists in a ruin near in northern Hjaalmarch that traces Ysgramor's line from his son to 100 years after Borgas' death. Still, as the scroll has been trapped in a barrow for centuries, even if it did exist, it would likely be useless to anyone save the oldest of clans.<br
/><br
/>Unlike most historical books, a family tree must be continuously updated or it will lose all efficacy. However, there are also records that suggest the Nords did not rely on the written word precisely because they had a far more exacting procedure. The Nords, it seems, believed that the blood of Ysgramor itself had a distinguishable quality.<br
/><br
/>Many blacksmiths will tell you the quenching of a blade is just as important as the fire that shapes it. One popular method is the usage of blood. Now, I realize skeptics will tell you quenching weapons in blood is at best an affectation, and at worst a deception. To say a sword was cooled in the blood of a Daedra certainly sounds like it would be more effective, but they contend there is no empirical evidence to suggest it is so.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Still, blood has often been shown to have magical properties. Its poisonous properties in vampires and werewolves have been well documented, and in the Bosmer rituals surrounding of the Wild Hunt.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Moreover, the most famous Nord of them all, Tiber Septim, was said to possess the blood of dragons, and the transformative power of blood is a well documented part of ancient Nord history. In fact, even common blood, whether it be mortal or animal, has the potential for a wide array of magical uses, as evidenced in both alchemy and many forms of witchcraft.<br
/><br
/>Thus it isn't impossible to suggest that the composition of blood carries a unique signature, one that can transform a weapon during the quenching process, and that the result would be a way of proving one's lineage.<br

But I've got a new lead, a wench at Ironheart Cave who's like a thousand years old. Them Elves live forever. And if she's had it this long, she must know how to keep a secret.<br
/><br
/>&lt;b&gt;12th of Last Seed, 4E 201&lt;/b&gt;<br

/><br
/>The existence of a mystery genius is not new to Tamriel, as evidenced by the world famous Gourmet.&nbsp; Yet the Gourmet only cooks for a chosen few, while it is said the Duke has shaped the face of Skyrim itself with his scissors.&nbsp; Of course, such exaggeration is typical of townsfolk.&nbsp; Even the origin of the nickname itself is poorly crafted.&nbsp; One would say the "Baron of Beards" would be a more fitting title, but alas, common folk cannot be expected to know the joys of alliteration.<br
/><br
/>Regardless, while the Duke has proved evasive, his admirers have not.&nbsp; One tavern maid insisted the Duke's craftsmanship had saved her marriage, while another traveler wept as he relayed the story of how the Duke had made his son a man.&nbsp; No doubt, Skyrim's fondness for the hirsute may play a role in this worship, but it is safe to say that most of the credit goes to the Duke himself, as he is proof once again that greatness takes many forms.&lt;/Source&gt;<br

/><br
/>Those were the words &lt;Alias=Player&gt; the Stone Hand vowed when I questioned his commitment. The last two men I hired didn't last the day.&nbsp; Casimir the Brave died defending me from a Forsworn ambush. His replacement, Sorek the Sellsword, fought valiantly against a Draugr lord, only to be felled by a wolf the morning after.&nbsp; &lt;Alias=Player&gt; was strong, peerless, but I wanted him to know that I fought from a distance.&nbsp; It would be up to him, and him alone, to hold the line.<br
/><br
/>&lt;Alias=Player&gt; relished the opportunity. His enduring hand was surpassed only by his tireless mouth.&nbsp; An Orc follows to the death, he reminded me, something a human would never understand.&nbsp; According to him, it wasn't the cords of muscle or the sharpness of his axe. It was his determination.&nbsp; That's what gave him strength.<br
/><br
/>Halfway through our journey we came across Gloomreach Cave, tucked against the rock near a grove of withered trees. The cave had been marked by Falmer. Nasty creatures with a taste for blood and a nose for treasure.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was wary of going inside, but &lt;Alias=Player&gt; merely laughed at my cowardice.<br
/><br
/>True to his word, I had nothing to fear standing behind this mighty Orc.&nbsp; Body after body fell to the ground with a mighty crash, his stone hand speaking as loudly as his mouth.&nbsp; Everywhere we went, the same sound kept ringing consistently in my ear.&nbsp; The sound of a skull cracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Two dozen cracks later and we reached the center of the hive.&nbsp; It was there that my eyes were drawn to the beautiful tassels of blue that lined the ceiling.&nbsp; I was mesmerized, so much so that I didn't notice the chasm that lay ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Alias=Player&gt;'s eyes were drawn as well, but to the Falmer who crept along the edge of the ravine.<br
/><br
/>&lt;Alias=Player&gt; did what he always did.&nbsp; He charged.<br
/><br
/>I nocked an arrow, hastily trying to shoot my companion in the leg and save him from his own aggression. Only my clumsy hands betrayed me.&nbsp; The Orc continued his stampede.&nbsp; I fumbled my bow.<br
/><br
/>Then a heard a sound.&nbsp; Only it wasn't the familiar crack of a skull.&nbsp; It was a sound I hadn't heard once in my time with &lt;Alias=Player&gt;.&nbsp; It was the sound of a blade, caroming off a shield.&nbsp; It was a block!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Never had I heard such sweet music.&nbsp; It was the force of the block, after all, that pushed my companion back to safety.&nbsp; Had &lt;Alias=Player&gt;'s blow struck, the momentum would have surely drove him off the ledge, and I would have been forced to mourn three followers in as many days.<br
/><br
/>I lit a torch and rushed to his side, nearly stumbling over a tiny ditch in my haste.&nbsp; I fully expected him to mock my late arrival, or weave this into another tale of Orc bravery. Yet the mighty Orc never turned to me. Gone were all the taunts and swagger. &lt;Alias=Player&gt; never moved.&nbsp; He simply kept his eyes fixated on the drop below.<br
/><br
/>He remained silent as we made our way back out of the cave. We found a passageway that brought us back to the entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp; All that was left was a single, ten foot drop.&nbsp; I threw down our spoils and leapt down after it.&nbsp; Dawn was on the horizon, and a shaft of light hit a small garden that managed to grow amidst the dim surroundings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The scene was breathtaking enough that even an Orc might appreciate its ordinary beauty, yet when I turned to &lt;Alias=Player&gt; I found him frozen on the ledge. He wasn't looking at the scenery.&nbsp; He was looking straight down. It was then that I noticed his hands. The Stone Hands were trembling.<br
/><br
/>I tried coaxing.&nbsp; Pleading.&nbsp; I climbed back up the ledge and tried pushing him, striking him, and when my arms grew weary I tried bruising his fragile ego. He never budged. An Orc follows to the death, he boasted, but the only thing dead was his nerves.<br
/><br
/>From time to time I would return to the cave to check in on my old companion. My old friend. I considered telling his brethren at Dushnikh Yal he died in battle, but I still hold out hope he will conquer his fear and spin it into another harrowing tale. Yet my fear is that many years and many followers later, &lt;Alias=Player&gt; the Fearful will still be waiting near the entrance of Gloomreach Cavern, unable to jump down from the ledge, a monument to everything an Orc should not be.&nbsp;<br
/><br
