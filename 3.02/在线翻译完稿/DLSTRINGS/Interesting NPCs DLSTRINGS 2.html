/>I had a close call at the market today.&nbsp; Some adventurer said we had met once before in Riverwood.&nbsp; Which is absurd.&nbsp; I never forget a face.<br
/><br
/>It's more likely he saw me on some wanted poster.&nbsp; Lucky for me, the Jarl of Winterhold holds no sway here.&nbsp; I'm not even sure the Jarl of Riften would bother with a horse thief.&nbsp; Too many criminals in one place.&nbsp; It's like trying to find a mudcrab in a chaurus hive.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>I should be more careful and stick to the Ratways.&nbsp; It's a good place to hide for three reasons.&nbsp; It's dark, it's isolated, and it smells.&nbsp; By Namira, does it smell.&nbsp; It's mostly on account of that mage, although no one here is foolish enough to confront him.&nbsp; I think you could survive a long time here just feeding off the skeevers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>But I didn't escape from that prison to trade one cell for another.&nbsp; I can't be complacent.&nbsp; I have to keep going.&nbsp; I'll steal a horse from the stable tomorrow night.&nbsp; If I can just cross the mountains before dawn, I'll be safe.&nbsp; No one in Cyrodiil knows who I am.<br

/>&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;&lt;/Source&gt;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Dest&gt;[pagebreak]&amp;lt;font face='$HandwrittenFont'&amp;gt;<br
/>今天在集市里我差点被抓住。有些冒险家说以前在Riverwood见过我。这不是扯淡吗，我认人可是过目不忘的。<br
/><br
/>他大概是在通缉告示上见过我吧。对我来说，冬堡领主在这里没有耳目真是个好事。我不太确定Riften领主是否会个一个偷马贼过不去。那里的犯罪太多了，想要找到我就像从chaurus巢穴里找出一只mudcrab一样。<br
/><br
/>我应该更加小心并藏在Ratways里。这地方作为藏身之处有三个好处：黑暗，孤立，恶臭。Namira在上，这里真的很臭。这基本上归功于那个法师，尽管这里没人傻到去和他对着干。我想你靠着吃雪鼠应该可以在这里活很久。&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>但是，我从监狱里逃出来可不是为了从一个号子进入另一个号子。我才不满意了。我要继续前进。明晚我就去驿站偷一匹马。如果我能在黎明以前穿过山脉，我就安全了。在Cyrodiil，没人知道我是谁。<br

/>&amp;lt;img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/A_letter.png'&amp;gt;n Orc follows to the death.<br
/><br
/>Those were the words Ghorbash the Stone Hand vowed when I questioned his commitment. The last two men I hired didn't last the day.&nbsp; Casimir the Brave died defending me from a Forsworn ambush. His replacement, Sorek the Sellsword, fought valiantly against a Draugr lord, only to be felled by a wolf the morning after.&nbsp; Ghorbash was strong, peerless, but I wanted him to know that I fought from a distance.&nbsp; It would be up to him, and him alone, to hold the line.<br
/><br
/>Ghorbash relished the opportunity. His enduring hand was surpassed only by his tireless mouth.&nbsp; An Orc follows to the death, he reminded me, something a human would never understand.&nbsp; According to him, it wasn't the cords of muscle or the sharpness of his axe. It was his determination.&nbsp; That's what gave him strength.<br
/><br
/>Halfway through our journey we came across Gloomreach Cave, tucked against the rock near a grove of withered trees. The cave had been marked by Falmer. Nasty creatures with a taste for blood and a nose for treasure.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was wary of going inside, but Ghorbash merely laughed at my cowardice.<br
/><br
/>True to his word, I had nothing to fear standing behind this mighty Orc.&nbsp; Body after body fell to the ground with a mighty crash, his stone hand speaking as loudly as his mouth.&nbsp; Everywhere we went, the same sound kept ringing consistently in my ear.&nbsp; The sound of a skull cracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Two dozen cracks later and we reached the center of the hive.&nbsp; It was there that my eyes were drawn to the beautiful tassels of blue that lined the ceiling.&nbsp; I was mesmerized, so much so that I didn't notice the chasm that lay ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ghorbash's eyes were drawn as well, but to the Falmer who crept along the edge of the ravine.<br
/><br
/>Ghorbash did what he always did.&nbsp; He charged.<br
/><br
/>I nocked an arrow, hastily trying to shoot my companion in the leg and save him from his own aggression. Only my clumsy hands betrayed me.&nbsp; The Orc continued his stampede.&nbsp; I fumbled my bow.<br
/><br
/>Then a heard a sound.&nbsp; Only it wasn't the familiar crack of a skull.&nbsp; It was a sound I hadn't heard once in my time with Ghorbash.&nbsp; It was the sound of a blade, caroming off a shield.&nbsp; It was a block!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Never had I heard such sweet music.&nbsp; It was the force of the block, after all, that pushed my companion back to safety.&nbsp; Had Ghorbash's blow struck, the momentum would have surely drove him off the ledge, and I would have been forced to mourn three followers in as many days.<br
/><br
/>I lit a torch and rushed to his side, nearly stumbling over a tiny ditch in my haste.&nbsp; I fully expected him to mock my late arrival, or weave this into another tale of Orc bravery. Yet the mighty Orc never turned to me. Gone were all the taunts and swagger. Ghorbash never moved.&nbsp; He simply kept his eyes fixated on the drop below.<br
/><br
/>He remained silent as we made our way back out of the cave. We found a passageway that brought us back to the entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp; All that was left was a single, ten foot drop.&nbsp; I threw down our spoils and leapt down after it.&nbsp; Dawn was on the horizon, and a shaft of light hit a small garden that managed to grow amidst the dim surroundings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The scene was breathtaking enough that even an Orc might appreciate its ordinary beauty, yet when I turned to Ghorbash I found him frozen on the ledge. He wasn't looking at the scenery.&nbsp; He was looking straight down. It was then that I noticed his hands. The Stone Hands were trembling.<br
/><br
/>I tried coaxing.&nbsp; Pleading.&nbsp; I climbed back up the ledge and tried pushing him, striking him, and when my arms grew weary I tried bruising his fragile ego. He never budged. An Orc follows to the death, he boasted, but the only thing dead was his nerves.<br
/><br
/>From time to time I would return to the cave to check in on my old companion. My old friend. I considered telling his brethren at Dushnikh Yal he died in battle, but I still hold out hope he will conquer his fear and spin it into another harrowing tale. Yet my fear is that many years and many followers later, Ghorbash the Fearful will still be waiting near the entrance of Gloomreach Cavern, unable to jump down from the ledge, a monument to everything an Orc should not be.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>An Orc who dare not follow.&lt;/Source&gt;<br

/><br
/>在 我要石拳Ghorbash作出承诺时，他发誓如上。前两任雇佣兵没能坚持到最后。勇者Casimir在一次弃誓者埋伏中为了保护我而牺牲了。他的继任者， 赏金猎人Sorek，据说曾勇敢的和一个尸鬼领主搏斗，第二天早上就被一头狼放倒了。&nbsp; Ghorbash强壮有力，独一无二，但我想告诉他，我可以远程参与战斗。这仅仅取决于他是否愿意。<br
/><br

/>路途中我们来到了Gloomreach Cave,隐藏在某片枯萎树林附近的一块巨石后。洞穴有雪精灵的标记。一些嗜好鲜血，追逐宝藏的恶心生物。进到这里面让我感到担心，但Ghorbash仅仅是嘲笑我懦弱。<br
/><br
/>正如他所说，站在这位孔武有力的兽人背后我没什么好怕的。在他的重击下，敌人不断地倒下，他的石拳名副其实。无论我们走到哪里，同一种声音一直回响在我的耳边——头骨碎裂的声音。&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>在足足两打碎裂声后，我们到达了巢穴的中央。在那里，我的目光被洞穴顶部的蓝色流苏吸引住了。我实在是太陶醉了，以至于根本没意思到面前的峡谷。Ghorbash的目光也被吸引住了——被那些在石壁上匍匐前进的雪精灵。<br
/><br
/>Ghorbash作出了一如既往的反应。他向着敌人冲锋。<br
/><br
/>我匆忙地搭上一支箭并瞄准了战友的大腿，希望能从他愚蠢的血性中就下他一命。<br
/>只是我笨拙的双手背叛了我，兽人依旧大杀特杀，而我在摸索我的弓。<br
/><br
/>接着我听到了一个声音。不同于平时击杀敌人的声音，而是一种自从Ghorbash跟随我以后从来没有听见过的声音。像是刀剑在盾牌上凿砍的声音。落石！&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>这简直是天籁之音。落石的力量使我的朋友免于血光之灾。若非如此，Ghorbash杀红眼了的话，说不定会莽撞的一脚踩空，坠入万丈深渊。这样的话我就不得不在未来的很长一段时间内悼念为我而牺牲的三位随从了。<br
/>我举着火炬，一路跌跌撞撞的冲到他身旁，我猜他可能会嘲弄我的姗姗来迟，或者把这一幕编织进兽人的那些勇敢传说之中。但是勇猛的兽人根本没有理我。离开时最直接的表示嘲弄的做法，但是Ghorbash没有离开。他只是直直地盯着深渊深处。<br
/>在离开洞穴的路上，他一言不发。我们发现了一条通向入口的捷径，是一个大约十英尺深的垂直通道。我先把战利品扔下去，然后自己也跟着跳了下去。黎明从地平线上缓缓升起，熹微的晨光映照着周围努力生长的花花草草。摄人心魄的景色足以使兽人为这无与伦比的美丽所感动，我发现Ghorbash怔怔地站在坑的边缘。他并没有注意到这景色，而是直直的向下看着。这时我注意到了他的手，正在颤抖。<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>我试着哄他、劝他。 我爬回去推他、摇他。胳膊酸疼。我开始试试挫伤他脆弱的自尊这种方法 ，他一动不动。他驾鹤西去了，豪言壮语也不得不屈从于死亡。<br
/>从那以后，我一次又一次地回到当初的洞穴门口，悼念我的老战友，老朋友。我在考虑将他战死的消息通知给他在Dushnikh Yal的同胞，但是我依旧抱有一丝他可能战胜恐惧涅槃重生的希望。 现在我所担心的是一年又一年，一任又一任随从，Ghorbash the Fearful仍然立在Gloomreach Cavern的门口，迟迟不敢跳下来，变成了一座兽人们最不愿看到的纪念碑。<br

/>&amp;lt;img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/A_letter.png'&amp;gt;n Orc follows to the death.<br
/><br
/>Those were the words Bogakh the Stone Hand vowed when I questioned his commitment. The last two men I hired didn't last the day.&nbsp; Casimir the Brave died defending me from a Forsworn ambush. His replacement, Sorek the Sellsword, fought valiantly against a Draugr lord, only to be felled by a wolf the morning after.&nbsp; Bogakh was strong, peerless, but I wanted him to know that I fought from a distance.&nbsp; It would be up to him, and him alone, to hold the line.<br
/><br
/>Bogakh relished the opportunity. His enduring hand was surpassed only by his tireless mouth.&nbsp; An Orc follows to the death, he reminded me, something a human would never understand.&nbsp; According to him, it wasn't the cords of muscle or the sharpness of his axe. It was his determination.&nbsp; That's what gave him strength.<br
/><br
/>Halfway through our journey we came across Gloomreach Cave, tucked against the rock near a grove of withered trees. The cave had been marked by Falmer. Nasty creatures with a taste for blood and a nose for treasure.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was wary of going inside, but Bogakh merely laughed at my cowardice.<br
/><br
/>True to his word, I had nothing to fear standing behind this mighty Orc.&nbsp; Body after body fell to the ground with a mighty crash, his stone hand speaking as loudly as his mouth.&nbsp; Everywhere we went, the same sound kept ringing consistently in my ear.&nbsp; The sound of a skull cracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Two dozen cracks later and we reached the center of the hive.&nbsp; It was there that my eyes were drawn to the beautiful tassels of blue that lined the ceiling.&nbsp; I was mesmerized, so much so that I didn't notice the chasm that lay ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bogakh's eyes were drawn as well, but to the Falmer who crept along the edge of the ravine.<br
/><br
/>Bogakh did what he always did.&nbsp; He charged.<br
/><br
/>I nocked an arrow, hastily trying to shoot my companion in the leg and save him from his own aggression. Only my clumsy hands betrayed me.&nbsp; The Orc continued his stampede.&nbsp; I fumbled my bow.<br
/><br
/>Then a heard a sound.&nbsp; Only it wasn't the familiar crack of a skull.&nbsp; It was a sound I hadn't heard once in my time with Bogakh.&nbsp; It was the sound of a blade, caroming off a shield.&nbsp; It was a block!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Never had I heard such sweet music.&nbsp; It was the force of the block, after all, that pushed my companion back to safety.&nbsp; Had Bogakh's blow struck, the momentum would have surely drove him off the ledge, and I would have been forced to mourn three followers in as many days.<br
/><br
/>I lit a torch and rushed to his side, nearly stumbling over a tiny ditch in my haste.&nbsp; I fully expected him to mock my late arrival, or weave this into another tale of Orc bravery. Yet the mighty Orc never turned to me. Gone were all the taunts and swagger. Bogakh never moved.&nbsp; He simply kept his eyes fixated on the drop below.<br
/><br
/>He remained silent as we made our way back out of the cave. We found a passageway that brought us back to the entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp; All that was left was a single, ten foot drop.&nbsp; I threw down our spoils and leapt down after it.&nbsp; Dawn was on the horizon, and a shaft of light hit a small garden that managed to grow amidst the dim surroundings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The scene was breathtaking enough that even an Orc might appreciate its ordinary beauty, yet when I turned to Bogakh I found him frozen on the ledge. He wasn't looking at the scenery.&nbsp; He was looking straight down. It was then that I noticed his hands. The Stone Hands were trembling.<br
/><br
/>I tried coaxing.&nbsp; Pleading.&nbsp; I climbed back up the ledge and tried pushing him, striking him, and when my arms grew weary I tried bruising his fragile ego. He never budged. An Orc follows to the death, he boasted, but the only thing dead was his nerves.<br
/><br
/>From time to time I would return to the cave to check in on my old companion. My old friend. I considered telling his brethren at Dushnikh Yal he died in battle, but I still hold out hope he will conquer his fear and spin it into another harrowing tale. Yet my fear is that many years and many followers later, Bogakh the Fearful will still be waiting near the entrance of Gloomreach Cavern, unable to jump down from the ledge, a monument to everything an Orc should not be.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>An Orc who dare not follow.&lt;/Source&gt;<br

/><br
/>Gildi used to recite these stories by the window in that old stone tower. She would pin her hair back so she could face the breeze, and let the cool air glide over her as the sun warmed the grass below. This Dunmer wench, the one I confide in, she has her eyes, and even her smile, but not her innocence.<br
/><br
/>"I never understood why Varyan betrayed him," I ask.<br
/><br
/>"Because Deneris asked him to steal from the Gods," the wench replies.<br
/><br
/>"But those aren't Gods. They're Daedric Princes. They're evil."<br
/><br
/>"You only say that because you're a High Elf. Azura, Mephala, and Boethiah. Before the Tribunal, we worshipped them. From our perspective, Boethiah liberated us from the Aldmer. From your perspective, it was a betrayal."<br
/><br
/>It's been years since I left the Darksteel, and I don't know why it's coming back to me now. The wench, however, claims to know desire, and she believes mine still clings to the past. She says Deneris and I are not so different. Two Altmer seeking the death of one man. Varyan.<br
/><br

/><br

/>&nbsp;<br
/>我离开黑铁已经有段日子了，我不知道为什么又会碰上这种事儿。然而，这姑娘声称能看穿内心的欲望。她仍然像那时一样放心我。她说Deneris和我其实没什么不同，两个Altmer都想要一个人的命。Varyan。<br

I am working on a drawing that illustrates this point and will send to you once completed, but I am running out of paper to capture the breadth of your sizeable ego.<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It further pleases me to notify you that I have learned of a massive cavern to the east called Fallowstone Cave.&nbsp; I am petitioning that it be renamed Tullius' Nether Region in your honor.<br

/>更令人兴奋的是，我发现了一个巨大的叫Fallowstone Cave的洞穴。我热切期望它能够被重新命名为Tullius的洞穴，然后被划归到您的名下。<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 诚挚的问候，<br

/>The ring is indeed imbued with a strange power. It allows me to summon the wolf spirit of the one bound to the ring.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>However, a more curious development occurred when I removed the ring and cast the spell. In the werewolf's place appeared what I believed to be an ordinary wolf. And yet it was far from such, and the only way I was able to cease its incessant blathering was to put the ring back on. I dare say I will never remove it again.&lt;/Source&gt;<br

Over time, Imperial influence led to the adoption of modern mausoleums, but the influence of the old ways are obvious to anyone who has ever walked into a Hall of the Dead.<br
/><br
/>Moreover, you don't have to be a student of Nedic history to see the influence, as even today one can find barrows strewn across the breadth of Skyrim. These ruins house everything from heroes to wizards to kings, some to keep looters out, others to keep ghosts in.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>At times, the need to honor the dead and protect their remains seems almost paradoxical. After all, the grand stonework used to build these monuments is precisely what makes them attractive to grave robbers.<br
/><br
/>It is a similar conflict that comes into play when discussing the bastard children of kings. Often times, children of mistresses are given high ranking positions, and even gain considerable prestige in their lifetime. Unfortunately, given their ignominious birth, they can never be rewarded with a proper burial chamber.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>On the other hand, to simply toss them in the earth with the commoners seems an unthinkable task for even the most hardened of fathers, and so as a compromise, there is evidence to suggest a barrow was built, deep underground, to honor those who could not be honored.<br
/><br
/>The two questions I get asked most often when discussing this cemetery is whether it houses any particular artifacts of note, and of course, the location of the cemetery itself. In fact, it's because I often forget the answers to both questions that I've decided to write this book, if nothing else but for my own reference.<br

/>While I will discuss the Axe of Forgotten Kings in my next work, The Beast Who Cannot Be Slain, the location itself is fairly easy to deduce when you think about the connection between old and new.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Just as the Hall of the Dead is influenced by ancient Nord burial chambers, so is the grand cemetery in Falkreath tied to Cemetery of Forgotten Kings. Falkreath Hold has traditionally been a fertile hunting ground, and the old Atmorans were famous for their love of the hunt, in life and death. One particular place of note is Orphan Rock, a natural monument that could have served as a spiritual site in days past.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Some say that until we find concrete proof of such a burial site, it remains idle speculation on my part. However, the proof is in the documentation. The only question is whether, like its more famous cousins, the barrow has stood the test of time.&lt;/Source&gt;<br

/>当然，咱们这些人没必要为了了解这些影响而去学习诺德人的历史，毕竟现在整个天际到处都是古代的坟冢。这些废墟里住着英雄们、巫师们还有统治者们。有的是为了防止入侵者入侵，有的是防止他们出来作祟。&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>有时，给予逝者的荣誉和保护他们的遗骸难以两全。毕竟，正是这些用来表现斯人功绩的宏伟的石雕巨构，吸引了盗墓贼们成群结队的前来参观。<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>国王们的熊孩子们之间的争执与之何其相似。通常，嫡出的子嗣能在宫廷内部的圈子里有很高的排位，甚至一辈子都锦衣玉食养尊处优。反之，如果他们的出身于市井乡野之中，说不定连被葬入墓穴的资格都没有。<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>但是，单纯的任由庶出的孩子曝尸荒野，即使对于铁石心肠的家长来说，也是一件难以接受的事情。所以，作为妥协，有证据表明，在地宫深处安眠着那些本没有资格葬入墓穴的人们。<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>目前有两个比较热门的问题：墓里有没有史前文物？墓在哪里？事实上，我经常记不住这两个问题的答案。所以我写了这本书，以供我自己参考。<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>那么，接下来我要说说遗忘众王【Forgotten Kings】之斧，永生巨兽【The Beast Who Cannot Be Slain】的位置，想想新规和旧约的关系就能轻松推理出来了。<br

/>It is widely believed that when King Borgas was consumed by the Wild Hunt, it marked the end of the Ysgramor Dynasty. While it did certainly mark the end in terms of their rule, it would be specious to suggest that Borgas did not have a single heir.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>As the events of the Oblivion Crisis show, the blood of Kings can be anywhere, especially given the appetite of those in power. Brothels, courtesans, mistresses...the only thing more pervasive than bastard children is the amount of secrecy employed to hide their existence. Not only is it an embarrassment to the Queen, but these children may feel entitled to that which is not theirs.<br
/><br
/>However, this presents a unique dilemma when the King leaves no official heirs. The Kingsmoot may technically solve the matter of accession, but given the stakes, the debate over who should rule often results in conspiracy, murder, and civil war.<br
/><br
/>The easiest way to choose is to remove the element of choice altogether, by limiting our pool of candidates to those with ties to the throne. In fact, nearly lost to the annals of history is the existence of a group who called themselves the "True Blood of Skyrim," a small but vocal faction who advocated putting a bastard child on the throne. When the question was raised of how to prove it, it was then that we saw the first recorded evidence of the ancient ritual.&nbsp; The original document is encrypted, but I have managed to decipher the pertinent phrase:<br
/><br
/>The axe born from blood and bones<br
/>To slay the beast who cannot be slain<br
/>When none deserve to sit the throne<br
/>We will bow to those who were born in shame<br
/><br
/>The axe born from blood and bones almost certainly points to the Axe of Forgotten Kings. When Borgas' corpse was retrieved in the aftermath of the Wild Hunt, it is believed a member of the Blood of Skyrim, demanding vengeance, stole and replaced one of the bones from Borgas during the retrieval. Legend says the edge of this bone axe could only be quenched by the blood of his kin.&nbsp; The third and fourth line undoubtedly refers to the bastard children.<br
/><br
/>The second line of the poem is the cause for debate. There is evidence that the slaying of a great beast is an important ritual in early Atmoran culture, to prove one's valor after proving one's blood through the quench. After all, if there's one thing Nords value above family ties, it's glory in battle.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Some believe the beast is the very same creature that slew Borgas, an immortal, dragon-like beast born of the Wild Hunt, in the same vein as Willy the Bitten and King Dead Wolf-Deer. Such beasts typically like to burrow underground, and the deep caves of Skyrim would seem like an ideal habitat.<br
/><br
/>This evidence points to a location near the Sea of Ghosts where Ysgramor himself was buried, or east in the snowy plains of Eastmarch. Further excavation of these sites should be paramount for any researcher interested in uncovering the truth behind this ritual.&lt;/Source&gt;<br

/><br
/>It has been long suspected that the thief has worked alone, and all evidence has pointed to this fact.

/><br
/>Although we have no definitive proof, this agent, who has subsequently retired, may have interfered further in the investigation of a forged birth certificate that would help the Raven maintain her cover. Even now, the existence of the original document will no doubt be known to the infamous bard, and she will likely make efforts to claim it.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>However, given the gravity of your war, I understand if your attention is diverted elsewhere. It seems many of the Jarls have ignored my previous letters, so I hope that you will at least consider the words contained within.<br
/><br
/>In the meantime, here is a copy of the true certificate of birth from which the forged document was derived. Please pass it among your guards for inspection. The wording of the forged certificate will likely be identical with the exception of a few altered words.&nbsp; Placing the documents side by side will allow you to identify the Raven.<br

Even now, the existence of the original document will no doubt be known to the infamous bard, and she will likely make efforts to claim it.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>However, given the gravity of your war, I understand if your attention is diverted elsewhere. It seems many of the Jarls have ignored my previous letters, so I hope that you will at least consider the words contained within.<br
/><br
/>In the meantime, here is a copy of the true certificate of birth from which the forged document was derived. Please pass it among your guards for inspection. The wording of the forged certificate will likely be identical with the exception of a few altered words.&nbsp; Placing the documents side by side will allow you to identify the Raven.<br

/>Anyone who has studied religious history knows that cultures often ascribe different names and rituals to what is ultimately the same god.&nbsp; Lorkhan, for instance, is known as Lorkhaj (the Moon Beast) in Elsweyr, Sep in Hammerfell, Sheor in High Rock, Shor in Skyrim, and Shezarr in Cyrodiil.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Similarly, the same can be said for fairy tales, legends, and even oracles.&nbsp; Most cultures will have different versions of the same tale, and the same can be said for the prophecy of the Long Night.<br
/><br
/>The first evidence we find of the prophecy is contained in a previously lost writing of Shalidor, in which he predicts the birth of five powerful magics that will "fell the day."&nbsp; The second comes in the form of an old Khajiit tale.&nbsp; As their reverence for the moons is well known, the verse focuses primarily on the shifting of Masser and Secunda to block out the sun.&nbsp; The passage reads as follows:<br
/><br
/>"When the dark magicks were cast, and the second moon rose to take its throne beside the first, and together they eclipsed the sun, and the night reigned forevermore."<br
/><br
/>There is some debate over whether this refers to the disappearance of the moons and the belief that the Thalmor conjured them back into existence.&nbsp; However, this is clearly not the case, as the passage reflects more ominous tones, whereas most in Elsweyr believe "dawn magicks" were responsible for returning the moons to the night sky.<br
/><br
/>The most curious version of the prophecy, however, comes from an anonymous writer Morrowind.&nbsp; In this version, the tale speaks of a child of destiny, born to develop ancient magics that will usher in a new dawn.&nbsp; It speaks little of the Long Night itself, except indicating that "The child of destiny will wrought war upon the day, (unreadable) when the hour is darkest, a new dawn will emerge."&nbsp; While it is ostensibly a meaningless, three-letter conjunction, the unreadable portion of the text is key, as whether the word "and" or the word "but" is used changes the meaning of the passage completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>As such, even amongst the same culture, there are two ways of interpreting the same prophecy.&nbsp; Of course, like legends or myths, prophecies can continue to grow and evolve, so long as they never come to fruition.&nbsp; For if the Long Night were to actually pass, there would be little trouble coming to a consensus.<br
