/>Are&nbsp; you an adventurer? Of course you are. Else you wouldn't be reading&nbsp; this. I am in need of a skilled person of your job description for an&nbsp; expedition of Gloomreach Cave. As for when the expedition begins, it has&nbsp; likely already begun.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>In other words, if you wish to receive&nbsp; your payment, I would head straight for the aforementioned cave and ask&nbsp; for Aldi. Actually, don't ask, just find me. Asking a cave beast&nbsp; anything will likely not get you the desired response.<br

/>I&nbsp; had a close call at the market today.&nbsp; Some adventurer said we had met&nbsp; once before in Riverwood.&nbsp; Which is absurd.&nbsp; I never forget a face.<br
/><br
/>It's&nbsp; more likely he saw me on some wanted poster.&nbsp; Lucky for me, the Jarl of&nbsp; Winterhold holds no sway here.&nbsp; I'm not even sure the Jarl of Riften&nbsp; would bother with a horse thief.&nbsp; Too many criminals in one place.&nbsp; It's&nbsp; like trying to find a mudcrab in a chaurus hive.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>I should be&nbsp; more careful and stick to the Ratways.&nbsp; It's a good place to hide for&nbsp; three reasons.&nbsp; It's dark, it's isolated, and it smells.&nbsp; By Namira,&nbsp; does it smell.&nbsp; It's mostly on account of that mage, although no one&nbsp; here is foolish enough to confront him.&nbsp; I think you could survive a&nbsp; long time here just feeding off the skeevers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>But I didn't&nbsp; escape from that prison to trade one cell for another.&nbsp; I can't be&nbsp; complacent.&nbsp; I have to keep going.&nbsp; I'll steal a horse from the stable&nbsp; tomorrow night.&nbsp; If I can just cross the mountains before dawn, I'll be&nbsp; safe.&nbsp; No one in Cyrodiil knows who I am.<br
/><br
/>&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/Source&gt;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Dest&gt;[pagebreak]&lt;font face='$HandwrittenFont'&gt;<br
/>今天在集市里我差点被抓住。有些冒险家说以前在Riverwood见过我。这不是扯淡吗，我认人可是过目不忘的。<br
/><br
/>他大概是在通缉告示上见过我吧。对我来说，冬堡领主在这里没有耳目真是个好事。我不太确定Riften领主是否会个一个偷马贼过不去。那里的犯罪太多了，想要找到我就像从chaurus巢穴里找出一只mudcrab一样。<br
/><br
/>我应该更加小心并藏在Ratways里。这地方作为藏身之处有三个好处：黑暗，孤立，恶臭。Namira在上，这里真的很臭。这基本上归功于那个法师，尽管这里没人傻到去和他对着干。我想你靠着吃雪鼠应该可以在这里活很久。&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>但是，我从监狱里逃出来可不是为了从一个号子进入另一个号子。我才不满意了。我要继续前进。明晚我就去驿站偷一匹马。如果我能在黎明以前穿过山脉，我就安全了。在Cyrodiil，没人知道我是谁。<br

/><br

/>&lt;img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/A_letter.png'&gt;n Orc follows to the death.<br
/><br
/>Those&nbsp; were the words Ghorbash the Stone Hand vowed when I questioned his&nbsp; commitment. The last two men I hired didn't last the day.&nbsp; Casimir the&nbsp; Brave died defending me from a Forsworn ambush. His replacement, Sorek&nbsp; the Sellsword, fought valiantly against a Draugr lord, only to be felled&nbsp; by a wolf the morning after.&nbsp; Ghorbash was strong, peerless, but I&nbsp; wanted him to know that I fought from a distance.&nbsp; It would be up to&nbsp; him, and him alone, to hold the line.<br
/><br
/>Ghorbash relished the&nbsp; opportunity. His enduring hand was surpassed only by his tireless&nbsp; mouth.&nbsp; An Orc follows to the death, he reminded me, something a human&nbsp; would never understand.&nbsp; According to him, it wasn't the cords of muscle&nbsp; or the sharpness of his axe. It was his determination.&nbsp; That's what&nbsp; gave him strength.<br
/><br
/>Halfway through our journey we came across&nbsp; Gloomreach Cave, tucked against the rock near a grove of withered trees.&nbsp; The cave had been marked by Falmer. Nasty creatures with a taste for&nbsp; blood and a nose for treasure.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was wary of going inside, but&nbsp; Ghorbash merely laughed at my cowardice.<br
/><br
/>True to his word, I had&nbsp; nothing to fear standing behind this mighty Orc.&nbsp; Body after body fell&nbsp; to the ground with a mighty crash, his stone hand speaking as loudly as&nbsp; his mouth.&nbsp; Everywhere we went, the same sound kept ringing consistently&nbsp; in my ear.&nbsp; The sound of a skull cracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Two dozen cracks&nbsp; later and we reached the center of the hive.&nbsp; It was there that my eyes&nbsp; were drawn to the beautiful tassels of blue that lined the ceiling.&nbsp; I&nbsp; was mesmerized, so much so that I didn't notice the chasm that lay&nbsp; ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ghorbash's eyes were drawn as well, but to the Falmer who crept&nbsp; along the edge of the ravine.<br
/><br
/>Ghorbash did what he always did.&nbsp; He charged.<br
/><br
/>I&nbsp; nocked an arrow, hastily trying to shoot my companion in the leg and&nbsp; save him from his own aggression. Only my clumsy hands betrayed me.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Orc continued his stampede.&nbsp; I fumbled my bow.<br
/><br
/>Then a heard a&nbsp; sound.&nbsp; Only it wasn't the familiar crack of a skull.&nbsp; It was a sound I&nbsp; hadn't heard once in my time with Ghorbash.&nbsp; It was the sound of a&nbsp; blade, caroming off a shield.&nbsp; It was a block!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Never had I&nbsp; heard such sweet music.&nbsp; It was the force of the block, after all, that&nbsp; pushed my companion back to safety.&nbsp; Had Ghorbash's blow struck, the&nbsp; momentum would have surely drove him off the ledge, and I would have&nbsp; been forced to mourn three followers in as many days.<br
/><br
/>I lit a&nbsp; torch and rushed to his side, nearly stumbling over a tiny ditch in my&nbsp; haste.&nbsp; I fully expected him to mock my late arrival, or weave this into&nbsp; another tale of Orc bravery. Yet the mighty Orc never turned to me.&nbsp; Gone were all the taunts and swagger. Ghorbash never moved.&nbsp; He simply&nbsp; kept his eyes fixated on the drop below.<br
/><br
/>He remained silent as we&nbsp; made our way back out of the cave. We found a passageway that brought&nbsp; us back to the entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp; All that was left was a single, ten foot&nbsp; drop.&nbsp; I threw down our spoils and leapt down after it.&nbsp; Dawn was on the&nbsp; horizon, and a shaft of light hit a small garden that managed to grow&nbsp; amidst the dim surroundings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The scene was breathtaking enough that&nbsp; even an Orc might appreciate its ordinary beauty, yet when I turned to&nbsp; Ghorbash I found him frozen on the ledge. He wasn't looking at the&nbsp; scenery.&nbsp; He was looking straight down. It was then that I noticed his&nbsp; hands. The Stone Hands were trembling.<br
/><br
/>I tried coaxing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pleading.&nbsp; I climbed back up the ledge and tried pushing him, striking&nbsp; him, and when my arms grew weary I tried bruising his fragile ego. He&nbsp; never budged. An Orc follows to the death, he boasted, but the only&nbsp; thing dead was his nerves.<br
/><br
/>From time to time I would return to&nbsp; the cave to check in on my old companion. My old friend. I considered&nbsp; telling his brethren at Dushnikh Yal he died in battle, but I still hold&nbsp; out hope he will conquer his fear and spin it into another harrowing&nbsp; tale. Yet my fear is that many years and many followers later, Ghorbash&nbsp; the Fearful will still be waiting near the entrance of Gloomreach&nbsp; Cavern, unable to jump down from the ledge, a monument to everything an&nbsp; Orc should not be.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>An Orc who dare not follow.&lt;/Source&gt;<br

/>&lt;img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/A_letter.png'&gt;n 一个誓死追随的兽人。<br
/><br
/>在 我要石拳Ghorbash作出承诺时，他发誓如上。前两任雇佣兵没能坚持到最后。勇者Casimir在一次弃誓者埋伏中为了保护我而牺牲了。他的继任者， 赏金猎人Sorek，据说曾勇敢的和一个尸鬼领主搏斗，第二天早上就被一头狼放倒了。&nbsp; Ghorbash强壮有力，独一无二，但我想告诉他，我可以远程参与战斗。这仅仅取决于他是否愿意。<br
/><br
/>Ghorbash喜欢这个机会。除了他无休止的唠叨，没什么可以超越他坚硬的拳。一个誓死追随的兽人，他提醒我，一些人类永远无法理解的东西。据他所说，带给他力量的不是强壮的肌肉，抑或锋利的斧头，而是他的信念。<br
/><br
/>路途中我们来到了Gloomreach Cave,隐藏在某片枯萎树林附近的一块巨石后。洞穴有雪精灵的标记。一些嗜好鲜血，追逐宝藏的恶心生物。进到这里面让我感到担心，但Ghorbash仅仅是嘲笑我懦弱。<br
/><br
/>正如他所说，站在这位孔武有力的兽人背后我没什么好怕的。在他的重击下，敌人不断地倒下，他的石拳名副其实。无论我们走到哪里，同一种声音一直回响在我的耳边——头骨碎裂的声音。&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>在足足两打碎裂声后，我们到达了巢穴的中央。在那里，我的目光被洞穴顶部的蓝色流苏吸引住了。我实在是太陶醉了，以至于根本没意思到面前的峡谷。Ghorbash的目光也被吸引住了——被那些在石壁上匍匐前进的雪精灵。<br
/><br
/>Ghorbash作出了一如既往的反应。他向着敌人冲锋。<br
/><br
/>我匆忙地搭上一支箭并瞄准了战友的大腿，希望能从他愚蠢的血性中就下他一命。<br
/>只是我笨拙的双手背叛了我，兽人依旧大杀特杀，而我在摸索我的弓。<br
/><br
/>Then&nbsp; a heard a sound.&nbsp; Only it wasn't the familiar crack of a skull.&nbsp; It was&nbsp; a sound I hadn't heard once in my time with Ghorbash.&nbsp; It was the sound&nbsp; of a blade, caroming off a shield.&nbsp; It was a block!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Never had I&nbsp; heard such sweet music.&nbsp; It was the force of the block, after all, that&nbsp; pushed my companion back to safety.&nbsp; Had Ghorbash's blow struck, the&nbsp; momentum would have surely drove him off the ledge, and I would have&nbsp; been forced to mourn three followers in as many days.<br
/><br
/>I lit a&nbsp; torch and rushed to his side, nearly stumbling over a tiny ditch in my&nbsp; haste.&nbsp; I fully expected him to mock my late arrival, or weave this into&nbsp; another tale of Orc bravery. Yet the mighty Orc never turned to me.&nbsp; Gone were all the taunts and swagger. Ghorbash never moved.&nbsp; He simply&nbsp; kept his eyes fixated on the drop below.<br
/><br
/>He remained silent as we&nbsp; made our way back out of the cave. We found a passageway that brought&nbsp; us back to the entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp; All that was left was a single, ten foot&nbsp; drop.&nbsp; I threw down our spoils and leapt down after it.&nbsp; Dawn was on the&nbsp; horizon, and a shaft of light hit a small garden that managed to grow&nbsp; amidst the dim surroundings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The scene was breathtaking enough that&nbsp; even an Orc might appreciate its ordinary beauty, yet when I turned to&nbsp; Ghorbash I found him frozen on the ledge. He wasn't looking at the&nbsp; scenery.&nbsp; He was looking straight down. It was then that I noticed his&nbsp; hands. The Stone Hands were trembling.<br
/><br
/>I tried coaxing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pleading.&nbsp; I climbed back up the ledge and tried pushing him, striking&nbsp; him, and when my arms grew weary I tried bruising his fragile ego. He&nbsp; never budged. An Orc follows to the death, he boasted, but the only&nbsp; thing dead was his nerves.<br
/><br
/>From time to time I would return to&nbsp; the cave to check in on my old companion. My old friend. I considered&nbsp; telling his brethren at Dushnikh Yal he died in battle, but I still hold&nbsp; out hope he will conquer his fear and spin it into another harrowing&nbsp; tale. Yet my fear is that many years and many followers later, Ghorbash&nbsp; the Fearful will still be waiting near the entrance of Gloomreach&nbsp; Cavern, unable to jump down from the ledge, a monument to everything an&nbsp; Orc should not be.&nbsp;<br
/><br

/><br
/>Those&nbsp; were the words Bogakh the Stone Hand vowed when I questioned his&nbsp; commitment. The last two men I hired didn't last the day.&nbsp; Casimir the&nbsp; Brave died defending me from a Forsworn ambush. His replacement, Sorek&nbsp; the Sellsword, fought valiantly against a Draugr lord, only to be felled&nbsp; by a wolf the morning after.&nbsp; Bogakh was strong, peerless, but I wanted&nbsp; him to know that I fought from a distance.&nbsp; It would be up to him, and&nbsp; him alone, to hold the line.<br
/><br
/>Bogakh relished the opportunity. His&nbsp; enduring hand was surpassed only by his tireless mouth.&nbsp; An Orc follows&nbsp; to the death, he reminded me, something a human would never&nbsp; understand.&nbsp; According to him, it wasn't the cords of muscle or the&nbsp; sharpness of his axe. It was his determination.&nbsp; That's what gave him&nbsp; strength.<br
/><br
/>Halfway through our journey we came across Gloomreach&nbsp; Cave, tucked against the rock near a grove of withered trees. The cave&nbsp; had been marked by Falmer. Nasty creatures with a taste for blood and a&nbsp; nose for treasure.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was wary of going inside, but Bogakh merely&nbsp; laughed at my cowardice.<br
/><br
/>True to his word, I had nothing to fear&nbsp; standing behind this mighty Orc.&nbsp; Body after body fell to the ground&nbsp; with a mighty crash, his stone hand speaking as loudly as his mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everywhere we went, the same sound kept ringing consistently in my ear.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sound of a skull cracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Two dozen cracks later and we&nbsp; reached the center of the hive.&nbsp; It was there that my eyes were drawn to&nbsp; the beautiful tassels of blue that lined the ceiling.&nbsp; I was&nbsp; mesmerized, so much so that I didn't notice the chasm that lay ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bogakh's eyes were drawn as well, but to the Falmer who crept along the&nbsp; edge of the ravine.<br
/><br
/>Bogakh did what he always did.&nbsp; He charged.<br
/><br
/>I&nbsp; nocked an arrow, hastily trying to shoot my companion in the leg and&nbsp; save him from his own aggression. Only my clumsy hands betrayed me.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Orc continued his stampede.&nbsp; I fumbled my bow.<br

Over&nbsp; time, Imperial influence led to the adoption of modern mausoleums, but&nbsp; the influence of the old ways are obvious to anyone who has ever walked&nbsp; into a Hall of the Dead.<br
/><br
/>Moreover, you don't have to be a student&nbsp; of Nedic history to see the influence, as even today one can find&nbsp; barrows strewn across the breadth of Skyrim. These ruins house&nbsp; everything from heroes to wizards to kings, some to keep looters out,&nbsp; others to keep ghosts in.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>At times, the need to honor the dead&nbsp; and protect their remains seems almost paradoxical. After all, the grand&nbsp; stonework used to build these monuments is precisely what makes them&nbsp; attractive to grave robbers.<br
/><br
/>It is a similar conflict that comes&nbsp; into play when discussing the bastard children of kings. Often times,&nbsp; children of mistresses are given high ranking positions, and even gain&nbsp; considerable prestige in their lifetime. Unfortunately, given their&nbsp; ignominious birth, they can never be rewarded with a proper burial&nbsp; chamber.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>On the other hand, to simply toss them in the earth&nbsp; with the commoners seems an unthinkable task for even the most hardened&nbsp; of fathers, and so as a compromise, there is evidence to suggest a&nbsp; barrow was built, deep underground, to honor those who could not be&nbsp; honored.<br
/><br
/>The two questions I get asked most often when discussing&nbsp; this cemetery is whether it houses any particular artifacts of note,&nbsp; and of course, the location of the cemetery itself. In fact, it's&nbsp; because I often forget the answers to both questions that I've decided&nbsp; to write this book, if nothing else but for my own reference.<br
/><br
/>While&nbsp; I will discuss the Axe of Forgotten Kings in my next work, The Beast&nbsp; Who Cannot Be Slain, the location itself is fairly easy to deduce when&nbsp; you think about the connection between old and new.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Just as the&nbsp; Hall of the Dead is influenced by ancient Nord burial chambers, so is&nbsp; the grand cemetery in Falkreath tied to Cemetery of Forgotten Kings.&nbsp; Falkreath Hold has traditionally been a fertile hunting ground, and the&nbsp; old Atmorans were famous for their love of the hunt, in life and death.&nbsp; One particular place of note is Orphan Rock, a natural monument that&nbsp; could have served as a spiritual site in days past.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Some say&nbsp; that until we find concrete proof of such a burial site, it remains idle&nbsp; speculation on my part. However, the proof is in the documentation. The&nbsp; only question is whether, like its more famous cousins, the barrow has&nbsp; stood the test of time.&lt;/Source&gt;<br

/>It&nbsp; is widely believed that when King Borgas was consumed by the Wild Hunt,&nbsp; it marked the end of the Ysgramor Dynasty. While it did certainly mark&nbsp; the end in terms of their rule, it would be specious to suggest that&nbsp; Borgas did not have a single heir.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>As the events of the Oblivion&nbsp; Crisis show, the blood of Kings can be anywhere, especially given the&nbsp; appetite of those in power. Brothels, courtesans, mistresses...the only&nbsp; thing more pervasive than bastard children is the amount of secrecy&nbsp; employed to hide their existence. Not only is it an embarrassment to the&nbsp; Queen, but these children may feel entitled to that which is not&nbsp; theirs.<br
/><br
/>However, this presents a unique dilemma when the King&nbsp; leaves no official heirs. The Kingsmoot may technically solve the matter&nbsp; of accession, but given the stakes, the debate over who should rule&nbsp; often results in conspiracy, murder, and civil war.<br
/><br
/>The easiest&nbsp; way to choose is to remove the element of choice altogether, by limiting&nbsp; our pool of candidates to those with ties to the throne. In fact,&nbsp; nearly lost to the annals of history is the existence of a group who&nbsp; called themselves the "True Blood of Skyrim," a small but vocal faction&nbsp; who advocated putting a bastard child on the throne. When the question&nbsp; was raised of how to prove it, it was then that we saw the first&nbsp; recorded evidence of the ancient ritual.&nbsp; The original document is&nbsp; encrypted, but I have managed to decipher the pertinent phrase:<br
/><br
/>The axe born from blood and bones<br
/>To slay the beast who cannot be slain<br
/>When none deserve to sit the throne<br
/>We will bow to those who were born in shame<br
/><br
/>The&nbsp; axe born from blood and bones almost certainly points to the Axe of&nbsp; Forgotten Kings. When Borgas' corpse was retrieved in the aftermath of&nbsp; the Wild Hunt, it is believed a member of the Blood of Skyrim, demanding&nbsp; vengeance, stole and replaced one of the bones from Borgas during the&nbsp; retrieval. Legend says the edge of this bone axe could only be quenched&nbsp; by the blood of his kin.&nbsp; The third and fourth line undoubtedly refers&nbsp; to the bastard children.<br
/><br
/>The second line of the poem is the cause&nbsp; for debate. There is evidence that the slaying of a great beast is an&nbsp; important ritual in early Atmoran culture, to prove one's valor after&nbsp; proving one's blood through the quench. After all, if there's one thing&nbsp; Nords value above family ties, it's glory in battle.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Some&nbsp; believe the beast is the very same creature that slew Borgas, an&nbsp; immortal, dragon-like beast born of the Wild Hunt, in the same vein as&nbsp; Willy the Bitten and King Dead Wolf-Deer. Such beasts typically like to&nbsp; burrow underground, and the deep caves of Skyrim would seem like an&nbsp; ideal habitat.<br
/><br
/>This evidence points to a location near the Sea of&nbsp; Ghosts where Ysgramor himself was buried, or east in the snowy plains&nbsp; of Eastmarch. Further excavation of these sites should be paramount for&nbsp; any researcher interested in uncovering the truth behind this&nbsp; ritual.&lt;/Source&gt;<br

/>His name is Drelas, although I do not&nbsp; know if it will be Drelas tomorrow.&nbsp; Today I was certain his name was&nbsp; Nelos, but for me certainty is little more than a feeling, and not an&nbsp; attribute I can trust.&nbsp; He, on the other hand, does not care for names,&nbsp; for he has taken to calling me housefly.<br
/><br
/>The Dunmer has been kind&nbsp; in helping me piece together my journey.&nbsp; He suggested given my&nbsp; background in magic, that I had come to Skyrim to visit the College of&nbsp; Winterhold, and mistakenly came to the Bards College in Solitude.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was either that, or like a good housefly, I followed the scent of dung.<br
/><br
/>However,&nbsp; Solitude is not as dirty or corrupt as Drelas would suggest.&nbsp; It is not&nbsp; home to beggars and thieves like Riften, albeit there is one Khajiit&nbsp; here who frightens me.&nbsp; His eyes watch the Dunmer's every move, and I&nbsp; cannot help but be worried for my neighbor.&nbsp; For his part, Drelas laughs&nbsp; off any suggestion that the Khajiit is here for him.&nbsp; As soon as&nbsp; someone wealthier comes along, he insists, the cat's eyes will be&nbsp; trained on him.&nbsp; As I take the carriage east to Winterhold, I can only&nbsp; hope this is not false bravado.<br

/>Thus&nbsp; my existence is like the housefly.&nbsp; Not the most attractive of&nbsp; monikers, although when spoken from the lips of a charming Dunmer, it&nbsp; almost sounds romantic.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>His name is Drelas, although I do not&nbsp; know if it will be Drelas tomorrow.&nbsp; Today I was certain his name was&nbsp; Nelos, but for me certainty is little more than a feeling, and not an&nbsp; attribute I can trust.&nbsp; He, on the other hand, does not care for names,&nbsp; for he has taken to calling me housefly.<br
/><br
/>The Dunmer has been kind&nbsp; in helping me piece together my journey.&nbsp; He suggested given my&nbsp; background in magic, that I had come to Skyrim to visit the College of&nbsp; Winterhold, and mistakenly came to the Bards College in Solitude.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was either that, or like a good housefly, I followed the scent of dung.<br
/><br
/>However,&nbsp; Solitude is not as dirty or corrupt as Drelas would suggest.&nbsp; It is not&nbsp; home to beggars and thieves like Riften, albeit there is one Khajiit&nbsp; here who frightens me.&nbsp; His eyes watch the Dunmer's every move, and I&nbsp; cannot help but be worried for my neighbor.&nbsp; For his part, Drelas laughs&nbsp; off any suggestion that the Khajiit is here for him.&nbsp; As soon as&nbsp; someone wealthier comes along, he insists, the cat's eyes will be&nbsp; trained on him.&nbsp; As I take the carriage east to Winterhold, I can only&nbsp; hope this is not false bravado.<br

However, recent&nbsp; revelations have caused us to question that validity of this evidence,&nbsp; in particular that brought about by a Penitus Oculatus agent by the name&nbsp; of Orenius Scilus, who may or may not be the Raven of Anvil's father.<br
/><br
/>Although&nbsp; we have no definitive proof, this agent, who has subsequently retired,&nbsp; may have interfered further in the investigation of a forged birth&nbsp; certificate that would help the Raven maintain her cover. Even now, the&nbsp; existence of the original document will no doubt be known to the&nbsp; infamous bard, and she will likely make efforts to claim it.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>However,&nbsp; given the gravity of your war, I understand if your attention is&nbsp; diverted elsewhere. It seems many of the Jarls have ignored my previous&nbsp; letters, so I hope that you will at least consider the words contained&nbsp; within.<br
/><br
/>In the meantime, here is a copy of the true certificate&nbsp; of birth from which the forged document was derived. Please pass it&nbsp; among your guards for inspection. The wording of the forged certificate&nbsp; will likely be identical with the exception of a few altered words.&nbsp;&nbsp; Placing the documents side by side will allow you to identify the Raven.<br

/>Anyone&nbsp; who has studied religious history knows that cultures often ascribe&nbsp; different names and rituals to what is ultimately the same god.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lorkhan, for instance, is known as Lorkhaj (the Moon Beast) in Elsweyr,&nbsp; Sep in Hammerfell, Sheor in High Rock, Shor in Skyrim, and Shezarr in&nbsp; Cyrodiil.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Similarly, the same can be said for fairy tales,&nbsp; legends, and even oracles.&nbsp; Most cultures will have different versions&nbsp; of the same tale, and the same can be said for the prophecy of the Long&nbsp; Night.<br
/><br
/>The first evidence we find of the prophecy is contained in&nbsp; a previously lost writing of Shalidor, in which he predicts the birth&nbsp; of five powerful magics that will "fell the day."&nbsp; The second comes in&nbsp; the form of an old Khajiit tale.&nbsp; As their reverence for the moons is&nbsp; well known, the verse focuses primarily on the shifting of Masser and&nbsp; Secunda to block out the sun.&nbsp; The passage reads as follows:<br
/><br
/>"When&nbsp; the dark magicks were cast, and the second moon rose to take its throne&nbsp; beside the first, and together they eclipsed the sun, and the night&nbsp; reigned forevermore."<br
/><br
/>There is some debate over whether this&nbsp; refers to the disappearance of the moons and the belief that the Thalmor&nbsp; conjured them back into existence.&nbsp; However, this is clearly not the&nbsp; case, as the passage reflects more ominous tones, whereas most in&nbsp; Elsweyr believe "dawn magicks" were responsible for returning the moons&nbsp; to the night sky.<br
/><br
/>The most curious version of the prophecy,&nbsp; however, comes from an anonymous writer Morrowind.&nbsp; In this version, the&nbsp; tale speaks of a child of destiny, born to develop ancient magics that&nbsp; will usher in a new dawn.&nbsp; It speaks little of the Long Night itself,&nbsp; except indicating that "The child of destiny will wrought war upon the&nbsp; day, (unreadable) when the hour is darkest, a new dawn will emerge."&nbsp;&nbsp; While it is ostensibly a meaningless, three-letter conjunction, the&nbsp; unreadable portion of the text is key, as whether the word "and" or the&nbsp; word "but" is used changes the meaning of the passage completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>As&nbsp; such, even amongst the same culture, there are two ways of interpreting&nbsp; the same prophecy.&nbsp; Of course, like legends or myths, prophecies can&nbsp; continue to grow and evolve, so long as they never come to fruition.&nbsp;&nbsp; For if the Long Night were to actually pass, there would be little&nbsp; trouble coming to a consensus.<br

/>The&nbsp; following is a rough draft of Part 4 of Chapter 7, which covers&nbsp; protocol in the event company employees are forced to hire mercenaries&nbsp; as a result of being stranded on an island due to events in Chapter 5,&nbsp; Section 3F or 6D. If you are stranded at sea, please refer to Chapter 6.<br
/><br
/>Note:&nbsp; Not all mercenaries can read, and a reminder needs to be added to make&nbsp; sure that an employee is on hand to read the manual to them.<br
/>&lt;/font&gt;<br
