/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Source&gt;After being persuaded to join the Radiant Dark, I informed Olivia that Nelos was ill and the Radiant Dark was all but finished. Having bought the ruse, any advantage she gained from Vanus' spells will be negated by her lack of preparation.&lt;/Source&gt;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Dest&gt;被劝说加入Radiant Dark后，我告诉Olivia Nelos病了但并不影响Radiant Dark的完成。这样一来，她无法做出准备，任何Vanus咒语带来的好处都将和她无关。&lt;/Dest&gt;<br

/>It's quite clear the Familiar took my notes east, in direction of Snapleg Cave. Why doesn't Gren understand I can't find the location of the beast without them? If he really is the descendant of Ysgramor, then it's a wonder how the dynasty lasted as long as it did.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>In another note, I think those bandits are starting to get impatient. They aren't used to all this standing around. I should suggest they go for a jog.&lt;/Source&gt;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Dest&gt;&amp;lt;font face="$HandwrittenFont"&amp;gt;<br
/><br
/>很明显Familiar将我的笔记带到了东方的Snapleg洞穴。为什么Gren不理解，没有他们的帮助我根本找不到那个野兽巢穴。如果他真的是Ysgramor的继承人，很难想象那个王朝经历了那么多风雨。<br
/><br
/>另外，我认为强盗们已经开始不耐烦守在这附近了，我建议他们出去走走。&lt;/Dest&gt;<br

/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Source&gt;I met S'vashni's former master Garrett in Skyshadow Crypt. He asked me to help him vanquish his pupil by using the Way of the Nine. As there is no time to undergo the training required, he has asked I borrow the power by walking the supplicant's road and receiving blessings from 8 avatars of the Gods, with Garrett himself representing Arkay.&nbsp; I received them all and should now return to Skyshadow Crypt.&lt;/Source&gt;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Dest&gt;我在Skyshadow洞穴见到了S'vashni前主人Garrett。他要求我以Way of the&nbsp; Nine征服他的学生。&nbsp; 由于没有足够的时间训练，Garrett以阿尔凯的名义建议我前往朝圣之路获取八位神祗的祝福以借得力量。我成功了，现在该回Skyshadow洞 穴。&lt;/Dest&gt;<br

/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Dest&gt;我准备将Olivia带到了陷阱并正式成为Radiant Dark的一员。多疑的Olivia将在我的忠诚表现后带上Vanus的法术书。她的优柔寡断将帮助我成功。我应当杀了她和她的随从并取得咒语。&lt;/Dest&gt;<br

/>As I pen this, Dalum-Ei has asked that I join him for a walk.&nbsp; I suspect one of us will not return.&nbsp; In all likelihood, that will be me.&nbsp; In the end, the answer was obvious, as was his reasons.&nbsp; He betrayed us because he could no longer betray his ideals.<br
/>I've served many leaders in my time.&nbsp; Some led with passion, some with anger, and others by example.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>When I asked Dalum-Ei if there was method that a great leader should espouse, he shook his head.&nbsp; He told me, there is no right way to lead.&nbsp; What matters is that you choose a method and stick by it.&nbsp; A leader must stand by his principles just as he must stand by his decisions.&nbsp; Only then will your subordinates respect you.&nbsp; And Dalum-Ei had my respect...as a soldier, as a leader, and as a friend.&nbsp; He never wavered.&nbsp; He always chose the side of honor.<br
/><br
/>Even now, I imagine that's what this is all about.&nbsp; Justice.&nbsp; Honor.&nbsp; In his mind, we killed those people, and we deserve to die. It is not something I agree with, but it is a decision I respect.&nbsp; He is, as he has always been, a person I respect.&nbsp; So shed not a tear for me, as I will soon be with my love, at long last.<br
/><br
/>I will leave you with this.&nbsp; That day near Thorn, when Moon-Tail spoke and gave you the strength you needed, it was no secret I wanted to speak, but nothing more needed to be said.&nbsp; Yet now, as you leave your old company, and perhaps, forge a new one, I give you a speech of my own:<br
/><br
/>I have watched you grow up from a young hatchling.&nbsp; You were the youngest amongst us, but you were as hearty as Arnwulf, as charming as Elia, as cunning as Moon-Tail, and as fearless as Ula-Wei.&nbsp; You have Indrel's luck and my words, and you are every bit the swordsman as Dalum-Ei.&nbsp; Someday, you will be just as fine a leader.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Still, above all, it is not our gifts to you, but rather, your gift to us that endures.&nbsp; You were our spirit.&nbsp; Our heart.&nbsp; Never forget that.&nbsp; I am sure &amp;lt;Alias=Player&amp;gt; sees this as well, which is why &amp;lt;Alias.Pronoun=Player&amp;gt; keeps you by &amp;lt;Alias.PronounPosObj=Player&amp;gt; side.&nbsp; Treasure that friendship as I have treasured yours.&nbsp; Farewell, my friend, and safe travels.<br
/><br
/>Bodan<br
/>&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;&lt;/Source&gt;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Dest&gt;&amp;lt;font face="$HandwrittenFont"&amp;gt;Anum-La,<br
/>当我写下这些时，Dalum-Ei邀请我出去散步。 我猜测我们只有一个人能活着回来，这个人很有可能不是我。但很明显，是因为他的原因。他已经无法再背弃他心中的理想。<br
/>我一生效忠过很多领袖，有些充满激情，有些御下以暴，其他的只是人云亦云。<br
/><br
/>我 曾询问Dalum-Ei是否存在一位英明的领袖值得所有人拥护时，他摇头了。他告诉我没有任何领导是绝对正确的，只要选择一种方式去做就是了。一位领袖需 要有自己的准则并做到一言九鼎，这样你的追随者才会尊重你。Dalum-Ei以一位战士，一位领袖，一位朋友的身份获得了我的尊重。他从不胆怯动摇，总是 以荣誉为重。<br
/><br
/>直到现在我都理解他说这些话的原因，追求公正与荣誉。对他而言，我们杀过人，理当一死。我尊重他的想法，尽管我并不同意。他一直都是一位值得尊重的人。 我并不会悲伤，应为我即将与我的所爱团聚。<br
/><br
/>我要给你留下这个。接近Thorn的那天，当Moon-Tail和你讲话并给予你所需的力量时，我想说这不是什么秘密，但没必要多费口舌。现在，当你准备抛弃过去，寻找新生活和新伙伴时，我有些话对你说。<br
/><br
/>我见证这你从襁褓中长大，尽管你是我们中最年轻的，你却像 Arnwulf一样强壮，Elia一样美貌， Moon-Tail一样狡诈，Ula-Wei一样无畏。你拥有Indrel的幸运和我的口才，你的剑术像Dalum-Ei一样好。总有一天你会成为一位优秀的领袖。<br
/><br
/>无 论如何，与其说这些是我们教给你的，不如说你在带领我们。不要忘记你是我们的精神象征，我们的核心领袖。我很确定&amp;lt;Alias=Player&amp;gt;也知道这一点，这就是为什么&amp;lt;Alias.Pronoun=Player&amp;gt;&nbsp; 选择你在&amp;lt;Alias.PronounPosObj=Player&amp;gt;。我只希望你能珍惜这段友谊，就像我珍惜你一样。再见，朋友，祝一路顺 风。<br

/>&amp;lt;p align="left"&amp;gt;<br
/>&amp;lt;img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'&amp;gt;he hero was curious. It was not an uncommon affliction for people &amp;lt;Alias.PronounPosObj=Player&amp;gt; age, but for &amp;lt;Alias=Player&amp;gt; it was almost a sickness. It was the reason &amp;lt;Alias.Pronoun=Player&amp;gt; stole into the witch's cabin, and the reason &amp;lt;Alias.Pronoun=Player&amp;gt; was reading the book now. For what were books but another kind of door, and to open them was to open a world of possibilities.<br
/><br
/>In Skyrim, &amp;lt;Alias=Player&amp;gt; had opened many doors like this one, and they all made the same promise. Behind it were tales of conspiracy, tragedy, valor, sacrifice, and sometimes, even love. The more doors you opened, the further you descended, losing yourself in every chamber, every corner of every room.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>But alas, behind this door &amp;lt;Alias.Pronoun=Player&amp;gt; found neither knights nor sorcery, nobles nor thieves. There were no clashes between light and dark, sword and shield, earth and sky. All &amp;lt;Alias.Pronoun=Player&amp;gt; found was an empty room, save for a single object placed in the center. A mirror.<br
/><br
/>This is not to say it was an ordinary mirror. The surface was fluid, almost as if it were about to spill out of its thick brass frame. If it did move, it moved slowly, yet it could hardly be called calm. It was thick, cold, and most of all, murky.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Now, the wise adventurer might turn away from such an ominous thing, but the curious one can't resist taking a peek. As for what &amp;lt;Alias=Player&amp;gt; saw, suffice to say &amp;lt;Alias.Pronoun=Player&amp;gt; wasn't entirely sure.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>However, weeks later, long after &amp;lt;Alias.Pronoun=Player&amp;gt; closed the door and continued on &amp;lt;Alias.PronounPosObj=Player&amp;gt; adventures, &amp;lt;Alias=Player&amp;gt; couldn't help but feel a hint of recognition when &amp;lt;Alias.Pronoun=Player&amp;gt; walked into the Windpeak Inn and approached the stranger by the wall.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>"What are you looking at?" the man asked, bending his lips into a scowl.<br
/><br
/>&amp;lt;Alias=Player&amp;gt; tried &amp;lt;Alias.PronounPosObj=Player&amp;gt; best not to smile. Somehow, &amp;lt;Alias.Pronoun=Player&amp;gt; already knew the man's name, his occupation, and why he was standing there. In short, &amp;lt;Alias=Player&amp;gt; knew exactly what &amp;lt;Alias.Pronoun=Player&amp;gt; was looking at. What &amp;lt;Alias.Pronoun=Player&amp;gt; didn't know, was how.<br
/><br
/>"Your name's Theron, I take it," &amp;lt;Alias.Pronoun=Player&amp;gt; said, "I'm here about the job."&lt;/Source&gt;<br

/><br
/>在天际，&amp;lt;Alias=Player&amp;gt;打开过无数这样的门。门后的故事有悬疑，有悲剧，有英勇，有牺牲，有爱情。门开的越多，你陷的越深，迷失在故事的每一个章节，每一个字符中。<br
/><br
/>可 惜，这扇门后&nbsp; &amp;lt;Alias.Pronoun=Player&amp;gt;找到的既非骑术也非魔法，不是阳春白雪更非下里巴人，没有光暗之争，没有矛盾之辩，也没有天地 之别。&amp;lt;Alias.Pronoun=Player&amp;gt;找到的房间里只有一样物体放置在中间，一面境子。<br
/><br
/>这不是一面一般的镜子。厚重的黄铜镜框下，镜面如液体般缓缓流动，冰冷粘稠，浑浊不清。<br
/><br
/>或许明智的举动是立刻离开这个不详之物，但好奇心却督促着你轻窥一眼。对于&amp;lt;Alias=Player&amp;gt;来说，他看到的事物让他迷惑。<br
/><br
/>已经有一周的时间自从&amp;lt;Alias.Pronoun=Player&amp;gt; 合上书并继续他的冒险了。但当&amp;lt;Alias.Pronoun=Player&amp;gt;走进Windpeak Inn时，他情不自禁的靠近了墙角的一位陌生人。<br
/><br
/>“你想干什么？"男子皱了皱眉头。<br
/><br
/>&amp;lt;Alias=Player&amp;gt;强烈控制着自己的笑意。冥冥之中&amp;lt;Alias.Pronoun=Player&amp;gt;似乎知道男子的名字，谋生，和他在此处的原因。&amp;lt;Alias=Player&amp;gt;知道自己在寻找什么，他所不知道的，是如何寻找。<br
/><br
/>"Theron是吧" &amp;lt;Alias.Pronoun=Player&amp;gt;说， "我为了工作而来。"&lt;/Dest&gt;<br

/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Dest&gt;据Jaspar Gaerston所说， Adonato&nbsp; Leotelli认为他的手稿读起来就像一个铁匠写的一样。无论Jaspar的作品怎么样，很面显铁匠不会写散文。由于Adonato不愿意读这篇手稿， 我必须咨询他人的意见。&lt;/Dest&gt;<br

/>The Myth of the 7000 Steps<br

/><br
/><br
/><br
/>[pagebreak]<br
/>&amp;lt;p align="left"&amp;gt;<br
/>&amp;lt;img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'&amp;gt;here is not a Nord in Skyrim who has not heard of The Throat of the World and the Pilgrimage of the 7000 Steps.&nbsp; Visitors from all nine holds come to Ivarstead and attempt to climb the mountain either out of curiosity or in hopes of finding spiritual enlightenment.&nbsp; As the journey is long and perilous, however, few if any ever reach the summit.&nbsp; There is little debate that doing so represents an astonishing achievement.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>There is some debate, however, over whether the difficulty of the pilgrimage is overstated.&nbsp; Not in terms of the environmental hazards, of which there are many, but whether the number 7000 represents an accurate count.&nbsp; The most damning evidence comes in the form of the local farmers, who routinely walk up and down the mountain in order to deliver supplies to High Hrothgar.&nbsp; The pace at which they do so seems to indicate that the distance traveled is not much longer than the breadth of Lake Tear.&nbsp; Given the width of the average step, a more accurate approximation puts the figure at a little more than 700 steps as opposed to 7000.<br
/><br
/>However, as climbing up a mountain is only half the journey, one could argue that the full pilgrimage requires roughly 3400 steps in summation.&nbsp; This still puts the total figure at a significantly lower number than the 7000 we have been led to believe.<br
/><br
/>There is little historical record as to where the number originated, as much of Nord folklore is passed on through the oral tradition of songs and poetry espoused by the Bards.&nbsp; As the Greybeards choose not to leave their towering citadel, they themselves cannot provide further illumination on the origin of the number.&nbsp; Moreover, as they make no efforts to profit from the myth, there seems to be little motivation for them to perpetuate it, although those who enjoy conspiracy may imply otherwise.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Ultimately, history is full of such harmless exaggeration, and this author sees little harm in the myth as a piece of cultural fiction.&nbsp; On the other hand, scholars who wish to study the history and architecture of the area, however, can look to documents such as this as a reference, without having to disrupt the mythology and folklore that gives the area its charm.<br

/>&amp;lt;img&nbsp;&nbsp; src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'&amp;gt;天际没有一个诺德人不曾听说世界之喉和7000台阶的朝圣之旅。九大要塞的来客来到Ivarstead为了满足好奇心或者获取精神启迪攀登这座高 峰。由于路途的艰辛，极少有人能到达顶点。这一旅程所能带来的成就存在一定争议。<br
/><br
/>有些人认为这一朝圣旅程的难度被过于夸大了。并不是因为 路上可怕的风暴雨雪，而是7000台阶这一数值的真实性。最有说服性的证据来自当地定期往High&nbsp; Hrothgar递送补给的农民。他们的脚步让这一路程似乎并不比跨越珠点小湖更困难。从平均脚步大小来看，一个更准确的推测将这传闻的7000台阶算成 约700步距以上。<br
/><br
/>不过攀峰只是旅程的一半，有人认为完整的朝圣之旅还需要艰难的3400步。不过这些数值总和仍然明显比我们所相信的7000台阶要少。<br
/><br
/>关于7000台阶这一数值，最早的历史依据是诺德百姓口口相传的民歌和呤游诗人唱奏的诗歌。由于灰胡子隐于高塔中，他们无法阐明台阶的确切数值。由于他们本身并不从传说中获利，他们不存在维护这一传说的可能，当然那些持阴谋论的人并不这么认为。<br
/><br
/>总而言之，历史总是充满这种无害的夸张，我本人也不认为这些代文化传说中的片段伤及任何人。不过，研究该区域历史文化的学者可以将类似于本文章的材料作为参考，而不用打破当地人营造的神秘气氛。.<br

/>Finn,&nbsp;<br
/>When did we last speak?&nbsp; It seems like ages since I last saw you, but only yesterday since those summer days by the Niben.&nbsp;&nbsp; You would draw those intricate maps in the sand, and we would scamper about hunting for treasure until the shrill call of our nannies would drag us back to the city for dinner.<br
/><br
/>This map you have drawn me is of little use it seems, for I have no doubt ignored its counsel.&nbsp; I have found the river, yet the rest of the directions seem to speak of another place, with trees and wildlife singing through the breeze.&nbsp; Where I stand now is a land of hills and valleys, its broad shoulders armored with a cuirass of rock.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>It is a small miracle that I have not gone completely mad, although at times I wonder if such a state would be preferable.&nbsp; Then, as if to mock my requests, the Gods let me witness an act of true madness, and I realize that I am still whole.<br
/><br
/>I dare not say more.&nbsp; The Reach is not a safe place for me to sojourn.&nbsp; Fortunately, I finally met a passerby I felt comfortable approaching.&nbsp; He was a Breton man, likely a servant of some sort, running an errand for his master.&nbsp; I wanted to ask him for directions, but how does one do so without knowing her destination?<br
/><br
/>I searched the depths of my memory for a name, a place, a feeling.&nbsp; I mumbled something about a college, a phrase without meaning or context.&nbsp; Yet somehow the Breton was able to decipher my cryptic plea.&nbsp; Wordlessly, he pointed to the river, then guided that finger northeast.&nbsp; That's where this college must be.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>It was in that moment that I thought of you, Finn. I thought of the Imperial City, of Niben, and the strident voice of the river at my feet.&nbsp; I need only follow its call.<br
/><br
/>- Lathgwen<br

/>Finn,&nbsp;<br
/>我们上次聊天是什么时候？我觉得仿佛过了几百年一样，可是那些&nbsp; by the Niben的夏日却好像是昨天。 你还会把复杂难懂的地图画在沙子上，我们从中探索寻宝的路线，直到乳母的尖声召唤把我们拖回城里吃晚饭。<br
/><br
/>你画给我的这幅图看来是没什么用啦，因为我已经可以忽略它的指引。那条小河我找到了，可其他的方向都是树和野生物，看来完全不搭边，我现在站的位置是一片丘陵和峡谷，它宽阔的肩膀由石头组成的护甲覆盖着.<br
/><br
/>我能挺到现在还没疯也算是个小小的奇迹了。尽管有时候我怀疑其实这种状态才更理想。接着，好像是专门为了取笑我的请求，圣灵们让我见证了真正的疯狂，而我发现自己还是完整的。<br
/><br
/>我不敢说得更多了。瑞驰不是一个安全宜居的地方。幸运的是，我遇见了个很好相处的过路人。他是个布莱顿人，大概是个仆人什么的，在为他的主人跑腿。我想请他指引方向，可是有谁能帮一个连自己目标都不清楚的女人指路呢？<br
/><br
/>我试着搜索自己的记忆深处，去找一个名字，一个地方，一种感觉。 我迷蒙中说到一个什么学院的事，一句没头没尾的话。但那个布莱顿人还是想办法理解了我的言语。他没有说话，指向一条小河，然后将手指引向东北方。那就一定是这个学院的所在。<br
/><br
/>就在那个瞬间我想起了你，Finn。我想起了那座帝国的城市，of Niben，和我在河里大步前进的水声。我只需要顺从它的召唤。<br

/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Dest&gt;你对达瑞琪说了个善意的谎言，尽管没有确凿的证据，但告诉他去往 High Hrothgar 的台阶真的有7000级，这重振了他的信心，通过你的帮助使他找到新的希望。&lt;/Dest&gt;<br

/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Source&gt;I told Garrett I had a vision from the Divines that the ritual should be held in the forests south of Dawnstar.&nbsp; S'vashni was waiting for us both in the forest just west of the Weynon Stones, and the two spoke briefly before engaging in battle.&nbsp; I decided to help S'vashni, as Garrett summoned 8 ghosts of Akavir using the power derived from the blessings I received.&nbsp; In the end, however, it appears as if Garrett has one, even in death.&lt;/Source&gt;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Dest&gt;我跟加勒特说我受到圣灵的启示指引，那个仪式应当在晨星城南的森林里完成。在Weynon&nbsp; Stones的西边，斯維雪妮在那里等候我们。他们俩简短地说了几句就动起手来。我决定帮助斯維雪妮， as Garrett summoned 8&nbsp; ghosts of Akavir using the power derived from the blessings I received.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, however, it appears as if Garrett has one, even in&nbsp; death.&lt;/Dest&gt;<br

/>This is nuts. Crazy. Whatever you want to call it, that's probably what it is. A lot of the hunters are spooked. This ain't some normal prey. We don't even know if it bleeds. All we know is it leaves behind a pile of bones.<br
/><br
/>No one said a peep when that Wood Elf showed up following the same blood trail. If I had my way, I would've shot her between the eyes right then.&nbsp; Ain't no coincidence she showed up around the same time as all the murders. I'd bet all my toes it was her. Might as well wager them before she bloody eats them.<br
/><br
/>Then she offers to hunt down the beast herself. Said it was her duty, and we agreed.&nbsp; Cowards, every one of us, me included.&nbsp; Not a surprise at all she comes back and tells us the beast still lives.<br
/><br
/>She says she wounded it. Tells us the thing bleeds. This is all a hunter needs to know. Of course, that also makes it the perfect lure. I'm telling you, it's the Wood Elf, and I'll go to Sovngarde cursing her name.<br

/>&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;&lt;/Source&gt;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Dest&gt;[pagebreak]&amp;lt;font face="$HandwrittenFont"&amp;gt;<br
/>疯狂，太疯狂了，无论你怎么想，这都太疯狂了。大多数的猎人都吓坏了，这根本不是普通的野兽。我们甚至不知道它是否受了伤，我们只知道，它所过之地，尸骨无存。<br
/><br
/>当那个木精灵出现追踪那些血迹时，我们都没有认真盘问她。如果早知道的话，我绝对会一箭射向她的眉心。绝对不是巧合每次有人死亡她都会出现。我用我的所有手脚指头打赌这是她干的，反正它们迟早也要被送入她的血口。<br
/><br
/>当她提出她要独自狩猎那只野兽完成自己的职责时，我们居然同意了。懦夫，包括我在内，我们就是一群懦夫。也难怪她会回来告诉我们野兽还活着。<br
/><br
/>她说那只野兽受伤了，而且伤的很重。这是猎人们最想听到的，当然，也是一个完美的诱饵。我告诉你，那个木精灵就是那只野兽，当我前往松加德的时候，我将诅咒她的名字!<br

/>Tonight's hunt went splendidly. We brought the two new fledglings along and showed them how the river conceals our movements. The Argonian boasted he could do without the potion, but the fool didn't realize it wasn't for his lungs, but for&nbsp; his eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>It wasn't long before he gave in and drank the vial. He complained of the taste. Onions, I told him. He thought I was joking.<br
/><br
/>The night fell quickly as we made our way to Windhelm. Now is when the hunt is most ideal. The surface of the river is layers thick, sturdy enough to walk across. Yet there are points in the floe where the ice melts at the slightest touch, and when the hunt begins, we phase through them effortlessly.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Their blood glows like hot suns, skating across the ice. I reach up and grab one by the ankle. He will make for a fine meal.<br
/><br

/>The tunnel is almost complete. To think it was only three-quarters of the way burrowed when we found it. I will miss our nightly forays into the river, but we have plenty of identities to use, and the Jarl's border policies have whittled our prey's numbers.&nbsp; Besides, Egren is right. There is something nostalgic about feeding this way, worming our way into the Gray Quarter, earning the people's trust, just as we did when we were children.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br

/>今晚的狩猎成果显著。我们带去了两个新手并给他们演示如何用河水掩护我们的行动。那个亚龙人吹他不用喝药也能做到，这蠢货可没想到那药不是为了呼吸，而是保护眼睛。<br
/><br
/>他很快就投降并且喝下了药水。抱怨味道太差。是洋葱，我告诉他。他以为我在开玩笑。<br
/><br
/>在我们前往风舵城的半路天就很快黑了下来。正是狩猎的最佳时间。河面结实的冰层足以行走。只是仍有一些浮冰会在极轻的压力下融化，而当狩猎开始时，我们就可以很轻易地穿过它们隐蔽入水。<br
/><br
/>他们的鲜血像烈日一样闪耀着，在冰面上滑动。我向上抓住了一个脚踝。用他足以做成一顿大餐了。<br
/><br
/>14th of Frostfall<br
/>地 道差不多准备好了。想想最初我们发现它的时候才只有四分之三的路可以通行。我会想念我们在水里的夜袭玩法，可我们有很多身份可用，而领主的边界警卫消减了 我们猎物的数量。另外，Egren说的对。这样日子过得才有怀旧风格，从地下钻进 Gray Quarter，取得人们的信任，就像我们从小就会的那样。<br

/><br
/>Those were the words Bogakh the Stone Hand vowed when I questioned his commitment. The last two men who had the misfortune of following me both felt the swift judgment of Arkay. Casimir the Brave died defending me from a Forsworn ambush. His replacement, Sorek the Sellsword, fought valiantly against a Draugr lord, only to be done in by a wolf as the two of us, exhausted from battle, attempted to set up camp in the hills. I may have been anointed blood-kin and bested his chief in fisticuffs, but I wanted to be sure Bogakh knew what he was getting into. My obsession with hoarding, combined with my pitiful constitution, regulated me to a support role. It would be up to him to hold the line.<br
/><br
/>Bogakh relished the opportunity. His thirst for blood and brawl were only surpassed by his bombastic proclamations of Orc toughness. As we headed east for Rorikstead, staying close to the river, he bombarded me with tales of heroism, not just his heroism, but the heroism of all Orcs. The Orc was a superior warrior, he claimed, not from strength of body (although it helps) but strength of mind. It's simple, really. Humans fear death. Orcs do not.<br
/><br
/>Halfway through our journey we came across Gloomreach Cave, tucked against the rock near a grove of withered trees. The cave had been marked by Falmer. At the entrance stood a decorative assembly of human bones, like giant blue butterflies on a stick. Pretty if it weren't so disturbing. The sophistication and macabre of their art tells you everything you need to know about the species. It was time to clear the hive. Bogakh grunted in agreement.<br
/><br
/>His stone hand spoke as loudly as his mouth, reverberating through the cavern as it split open Falmer skulls. He charged blindly on ahead as I harvested Chaurus eggs and admired the tassels of luminous blue that freckled the ceiling. The battle and lights were so intoxicating that neither of us saw how porous the inner hive was, the ground a literal honeycomb of death by falling. Only the real drop was further on ahead. A narrow walkway spiraling around a bottomless abyss. Bogakh didn't see it. All he saw was the coin of greenish, phosphorescent light on the face of a Falmer as it crept up from below.&nbsp; Bogakh did what he always did.&nbsp; He charged.&nbsp; Right toward the ledge.<br
/><br
/>I nocked an arrow, hastily trying to shoot Bogakh in the leg, save him from his own aggression. Only my clumsy hands betrayed me, and the Orc stampeded forward toward the enemy. As I fumbled my bow, I was suddenly interrupted by the plangent bell of metal on metal. It was a block! A beautiful, wonderful piece of music!&nbsp; As I looked up, I saw that my assumption was true.&nbsp; The Falmer had blocked Bogakh's blow, and it was the block that killed him and saved my companion.&nbsp;&nbsp; The redounding force had actually pushed the Orc back to safety. Had Bogakh's blow struck, I imagine they both would have careened over the ledge, and I would have been forced to mourn three followers in as many days.<br
/><br
/>Dragging my sack of Falmer bows, arrows, swords and shields, I stumbled over to Bogakh and patted him on the shoulder, lighting a new torch to illuminate the darkness. The Falmer had fallen with a mighty thud, yet his corpse remained pristine. As I looted it, I fully expected Bogakh to mock my late arrival, or weave this into another tale of Orc bravery at humanity's expense. Yet the mighty Orc never turned to me. Gone were all the taunts and swagger. Borgakh never moved, just kept his eyes fixated on the drop below.<br
/><br
/>He remained silent as we trundled down the slow curve to the bottom. Eventually we found a passageway that led back to the entrance. All that needed to be done was to drop down from a single, ten foot ledge. I threw down my sack of junk and treasure and leapt down after it. Dawn had come, and the ivory tree that stood by the entrance was flanked by four shafts of light. The scene was breathtaking enough that even an Orc might appreciate its ordinary beauty, yet when I turned to Bogakh I found him frozen on the ledge. Looking not at the scenery, but straight down. It was then that I noticed his hands. The Stone Hands were trembling.<br
/><br
/>I tried everything. I went back up the ledge and tried pushing him, striking him, and when my arms tired I tried bruising his fragile ego. He never budged. An Orc follows to the death, he boasted, but the only thing dead was his nerves.<br
/><br
/>From time to time I would return to the cave to check in on my old companion. My old friend. I considered telling his brethren at Dushnikh Yal he died in battle, but I still hold out hope he will conquer his fear and spin it into another harrowing tale. Yet my fear is that many years and many followers later, Bogakh the Cowardly will still be waiting near the entrance of Gloomreach Cavern, unable to jump down from the ledge, a monument to everything an Orc should not be.&nbsp;<br
/><br

At the entrance stood a&nbsp; decorative assembly of human bones, like giant blue butterflies on a&nbsp; stick. Pretty if it weren't so disturbing. The sophistication and&nbsp; macabre of their art tells you everything you need to know about the&nbsp; species. It was time to clear the hive. Bogakh grunted in agreement.<br
/><br
/>His&nbsp; stone hand spoke as loudly as his mouth, reverberating through the&nbsp; cavern as it split open Falmer skulls. He charged blindly on ahead as I&nbsp; harvested Chaurus eggs and admired the tassels of luminous blue that&nbsp; freckled the ceiling. The battle and lights were so intoxicating that&nbsp; neither of us saw how porous the inner hive was, the ground a literal&nbsp; honeycomb of death by falling. Only the real drop was further on ahead. A&nbsp; narrow walkway spiraling around a bottomless abyss. Bogakh didn't see&nbsp; it. All he saw was the coin of greenish, phosphorescent light on the&nbsp; face of a Falmer as it crept up from below.&nbsp; Bogakh did what he always&nbsp; did.&nbsp; He charged.&nbsp; Right toward the ledge.<br
/><br
/>I nocked an arrow,&nbsp; hastily trying to shoot Bogakh in the leg, save him from his own&nbsp; aggression. Only my clumsy hands betrayed me, and the Orc stampeded&nbsp; forward toward the enemy. As I fumbled my bow, I was suddenly&nbsp; interrupted by the plangent bell of metal on metal. It was a block! A&nbsp; beautiful, wonderful piece of music!&nbsp; As I looked up, I saw that my&nbsp; assumption was true.&nbsp; The Falmer had blocked Bogakh's blow, and it was&nbsp; the block that killed him and saved my companion.&nbsp;&nbsp; The redounding force&nbsp; had actually pushed the Orc back to safety. Had Bogakh's blow struck, I&nbsp; imagine they both would have careened over the ledge, and I would have&nbsp; been forced to mourn three followers in as many days.<br
/><br
/>Dragging my&nbsp; sack of Falmer bows, arrows, swords and shields, I stumbled over to&nbsp; Bogakh and patted him on the shoulder, lighting a new torch to&nbsp; illuminate the darkness. The Falmer had fallen with a mighty thud, yet&nbsp; his corpse remained pristine. As I looted it, I fully expected Bogakh to&nbsp; mock my late arrival, or weave this into another tale of Orc bravery at&nbsp; humanity's expense. Yet the mighty Orc never turned to me. Gone were&nbsp; all the taunts and swagger. Borgakh never moved, just kept his eyes&nbsp; fixated on the drop below.<br
/><br
/>He remained silent as we trundled down&nbsp; the slow curve to the bottom. Eventually we found a passageway that led&nbsp; back to the entrance. All that needed to be done was to drop down from a&nbsp; single, ten foot ledge. I threw down my sack of junk and treasure and&nbsp; leapt down after it. Dawn had come, and the ivory tree that stood by the&nbsp; entrance was flanked by four shafts of light. The scene was&nbsp; breathtaking enough that even an Orc might appreciate its ordinary&nbsp; beauty, yet when I turned to Bogakh I found him frozen on the ledge.&nbsp; Looking not at the scenery, but straight down. It was then that I&nbsp; noticed his hands. The Stone Hands were trembling.<br
/><br
/>I tried&nbsp; everything. I went back up the ledge and tried pushing him, striking&nbsp; him, and when my arms tired I tried bruising his fragile ego. He never&nbsp; budged. An Orc follows to the death, he boasted, but the only thing dead&nbsp; was his nerves.<br
/><br
/>From time to time I would return to the cave to&nbsp; check in on my old companion. My old friend. I considered telling his&nbsp; brethren at Dushnikh Yal he died in battle, but I still hold out hope he&nbsp; will conquer his fear and spin it into another harrowing tale. Yet my&nbsp; fear is that many years and many followers later, Bogakh the Cowardly&nbsp; will still be waiting near the entrance of Gloomreach Cavern, unable to&nbsp; jump down from the ledge, a monument to everything an Orc should not&nbsp; be.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>An Orc who dare not follow.&lt;/Dest&gt;<br

The place was a mess, but not in the way he remembered. The bedrolls were facing the wrong way. The mead had been swapped out for ale. It was a bandit lair alright, the same as all the others, but entirely different.<br
/><br
/>"Talos' beard! I hardly recognize the place. Is that a sodding book on the table?" he said, returning to the things he did recognize. Weapon racks, purses full of gold, and a few trophies from back when the crew was whole.<br
/><br
/>"Every one of these things has a story," he said, beaming like a proud father whose children had just come home, "Take this pendant for example. Got it off a carriage moving a noble's family to Solitude. It was locked in a safe, you see, and try as we might nobody could crack it. This noble, he tried to bargain with me, saying he'd open the safe if I spared his blushing bride. So I said sure, 'A deal's a deal. Open the safe and I won't lay a hand on your girl.' Of course, I never said anything about my men!"<br
/><br
/>There was something about the way Theron chortled that bothered &amp;lt;Alias=Player&amp;gt;. It was a bestial laugh, the kind of foul grunt that makes you forget he was once a man.<br
/><br
/>It was the same laugh that haunted the writer's dreams. Even now, alone at his table in Castle Dour Dungeon, it crawled over his bones, reminding him of that horrible night. It was a laugh that shrunk his very soul.<br
/><br
/>"Anyways, the funny part is I couldn't pawn it," Theron continued, "with the bloody inscription on the back. 'To my darling Cassandra.' Why couldn't he have just married a girl named Helga?"<br
/><br
/>For Theron, there was a point to this story. It was Argis who told him the pendant couldn't be fenced, and it was Argis who sent him a letter the day before. The sellsword he had promised Theron would not be coming. The Nord had failed to come through once more. The question was, who was the imposter who claimed otherwise?<br
/><br
/>Theron approached the stranger, his hand shadowing his sword hilt.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>"Of course, I blame Argis," he said, "If he was half the fence he claimed to be, he could sell the thing for twice what it was worth! Not that I need to tell you, seeing as you used to work for him."<br
/><br

/><br
/>I just want to pass this warning along about the old tower east of Lost Echo Cave. I set out camp just off the road and went to sleep, but halfway through the night I woke up to strange chanting coming from the roof.&nbsp;<br

/><br
/>Those were the words Gromash the Stone Hand vowed when I questioned his commitment. The last two men I hired didn't last the day.&nbsp; Casimir the Brave died defending me from a Forsworn ambush. His replacement, Sorek the Sellsword, fought valiantly against a Draugr lord, only to be felled by a wolf the morning after.&nbsp; Gromash was strong, peerless, but I wanted him to know that I fought from a distance.&nbsp; It would be up to him, and him alone, to hold the line.<br
/><br
/>Gromash relished the opportunity. His enduring hand was surpassed only by his tireless mouth.&nbsp; An Orc follows to the death, he reminded me, something a human would never understand.&nbsp; According to him, it wasn't the cords of muscle or the sharpness of his axe. It was his determination.&nbsp; That's what gave him strength.<br
/><br
/>Halfway through our journey we came across Gloomreach Cave, tucked against the rock near a grove of withered trees. The cave had been marked by Falmer. Nasty creatures with a taste for blood and a nose for treasure.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was wary of going inside, but Gromash merely laughed at my cowardice.<br
/><br
/>True to his word, I had nothing to fear standing behind this mighty Orc.&nbsp; Body after body fell to the ground with a mighty crash, his stone hand speaking as loudly as his mouth.&nbsp; Everywhere we went, the same sound kept ringing consistently in my ear.&nbsp; The sound of a skull cracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Two dozen cracks later and we reached the center of the hive.&nbsp; It was there that my eyes were drawn to the beautiful tassels of blue that lined the ceiling.&nbsp; I was mesmerized, so much so that I didn't notice the chasm that lay ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gromash's eyes were drawn as well, but to the Falmer who crept along the edge of the ravine.<br
/><br
/>Gromash did what he always did.&nbsp; He charged.<br
/><br
/>I nocked an arrow, hastily trying to shoot my companion in the leg and save him from his own aggression. Only my clumsy hands betrayed me.&nbsp; The Orc continued his stampede.&nbsp; I fumbled my bow.<br
/><br
/>Then a heard a sound.&nbsp; Only it wasn't the familiar crack of a skull.&nbsp; It was a sound I hadn't heard once in my time with Gromash.&nbsp; It was the sound of a blade, caroming off a shield.&nbsp; It was a block!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Never had I heard such sweet music.&nbsp; It was the force of the block, after all, that pushed my companion back to safety.&nbsp; Had Gromash's blow struck, the momentum would have surely drove him off the ledge, and I would have been forced to mourn three followers in as many days.<br
/><br
/>I lit a torch and rushed to his side, nearly stumbling over a tiny ditch in my haste.&nbsp; I fully expected him to mock my late arrival, or weave this into another tale of Orc bravery. Yet the mighty Orc never turned to me. Gone were all the taunts and swagger. Gromash never moved.&nbsp; He simply kept his eyes fixated on the drop below.<br
/><br
/>He remained silent as we made our way back out of the cave. We found a passageway that brought us back to the entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp; All that was left was a single, ten foot drop.&nbsp; I threw down our spoils and leapt down after it.&nbsp; Dawn was on the horizon, and a shaft of light hit a small garden that managed to grow amidst the dim surroundings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The scene was breathtaking enough that even an Orc might appreciate its ordinary beauty, yet when I turned to Gromash I found him frozen on the ledge. He wasn't looking at the scenery.&nbsp; He was looking straight down. It was then that I noticed his hands. The Stone Hands were trembling.<br
/><br
/>I tried coaxing.&nbsp; Pleading.&nbsp; I climbed back up the ledge and tried pushing him, striking him, and when my arms grew weary I tried bruising his fragile ego. He never budged. An Orc follows to the death, he boasted, but the only thing dead was his nerves.<br
/><br
/>From time to time I would return to the cave to check in on my old companion. My old friend. I considered telling his brethren at Dushnikh Yal he died in battle, but I still hold out hope he will conquer his fear and spin it into another harrowing tale. Yet my fear is that many years and many followers later, Gromash the Fearful will still be waiting near the entrance of Gloomreach Cavern, unable to jump down from the ledge, a monument to everything an Orc should not be.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>An Orc who dare not follow.&lt;/Source&gt;<br

/><br

/><br
/>Skjarn in Dragon Bridge - Good lute player, strong voice, terribly arrogant. The Jarl wouldn't like that one bit.<br
/><br
/>Aia Arria at the Bard's College - I don't really want to go begging at the College, but if I had to, I would go with Aia before I ask Pantea. Besides, the Jarl specifically said no flutes.<br
